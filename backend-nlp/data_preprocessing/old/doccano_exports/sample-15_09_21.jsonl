The Group operates in countries subject to greater political, economic and social uncertainties than countries with more developed institutional structures. As a result thereof, unforeseeable and unfavourable changes in legislation or other regulations may occur in one or more countries of operation. There is a risk that such events and political instability in any country where the Group operates, as well as the Company’s failure to protect against such risks, will require the Group to discontinue existing products, services, business models or the businesses altogether in the affected countries. The Company considers the probability of such risk materialising wholly or partially in one country in the ordinary course to be high. If the above risk were to materialise in one country, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low but if multiple instances occur in rapid succession, then the impact moves to high. Loss of a deduction code. As at 30 September 2019, at source loans amounted to approximately 99.3 per cent. of the total assets of the Group. The Group relies on the ability to collect directly from the payroll of its customers in order to service the outstanding loans, which is facilitated through deduction codes. The Company is allocated a deduction code to be able to collect directly from an employee’s (the borrower’s) payroll. Loss of a deduction code would necessitate any new loans to be collected via an alternative mechanism other than payroll. Without the Company’s possibility to collect directly from the borrower’s payroll there is a risk that the Company would need to re-price the loan offerings due to the increased collection risk and that the number of non-performing loans on such new loans would increase from today’s average level of 4.8 per cent. of non-performing loans. The Company considers the probability of such risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high if the code relates to a central government deduction in a large subsidiary and low if the code relates to a branch of government or a private employer. License requirements. In most countries of operation, the Group is dependent on various licenses, concessions and other permits or permissions from local authorities to conduct its business, and the Group will likely be required to obtain new licenses and/or permits in other jurisdictions in the future. If the Group is unable to obtain or retain necessary licenses and/or permits, it could be time-consuming to renew such existing licenses and permits or to apply for new licenses and permits and result in diversion of management’s attention from existing core business. It could also negatively affect the Group’s revenue and operations since it could become unlawful for the Group to conduct its business in one or more jurisdictions. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising to be low. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high. Currency risks. The Group’s results of operations are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Since the consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in USD, the Group also faces a currency translation risk to the extent that the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company or its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than USD. Consequently, there is a risk that fluctuations in the value of the USD versus local currencies of the Company or its subsidiaries will affect the amount of these items in the Group’s consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in the original currency. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising to be high. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high. \nKey information on the securities \nWhat are the main features of the securities? \nSecurities Eight hundred (800) Bonds were issued in the Bond Issue, each Bond with a nominal amount of USD 100,000. The Bonds are debt instruments with ISIN NO0010871601 registered under Norwegian law and intended for public trading. The Bonds, including the obligation to pay interest thereon, constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer. The rights and claims of the holders in respect of the Bonds against the Issuer are subordinated in right of payment to any present or future claims of all unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer. 6 \nThe Bonds bear interest from (and including) the relevant issue date up to (but excluding) the relevant redemption date. Any subsequent bonds will carry interest from (and including) the interest payment date falling immediately prior to their issuance up to (but excluding) the relevant redemption date. The interest rate is a fixed rate of 10.50 per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on 19 June and 19 December each year or, to the extent such day is not a business day, the first following day that is a business day. \nWhere will the securities be traded? \nAdmission to trading The Bonds will be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Stockholm Sustainable Bond List or, if such admission to trading is not possible to attain or obtain, at another regulated market. \nWhat are the key risks that are specific to the securities? \nRisks Subordinated obligations. The Bonds are subordinated to all of the Company’s unsubordinated present and future debts. In the event the Company will be subject to any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, the Company will be required to pay all prioritised creditors and all unsubordinated creditors (including holders of any unsubordinated market debt) in full before the Company makes any payment on the Bonds. Due to the unsecured and subordinated nature of the Bonds there is a risk that an investor in the Bonds may lose all or part of its investment in the event of liquidation or insolvency of the Company. Dependency on Group companies. The Company holds no significant assets other than the shares in the Group companies. The Company is dependent on the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its Group companies, and their direct and indirect subsidiaries, sufficient to fulfil its payment obligations under the terms and conditions of the Bonds. The ability of the portfolio companies to make such payments to the Company is subject to, among other things, the profitability the Group companies and/or funds available therefrom, or legal or contractual restrictions on the upstreaming of cash. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high. \nKey information on the admission to trading on a regulated market \nWhy is this prospectus being produced? \nReasons and use of issue proceeds The Issuer has the intention and shall use its best efforts (without assuming any legal or contractual obligation) to ensure that the Bonds issued on the Issue Date are admitted to trading on Nasdaq Stockholm Sustainable Bond (or another regulated market) within thirty days after the Issue Date. This Prospectus has been prepared to enable the Bonds to be admitted to trading on such regulated market. \nThe net proceeds from the Bond Issue are to be used in accordance with the Social Bond Framework to finance general corporate purposes of the Group, including investments, acquisitions and repurchases of social bonds with ISIN NO0010856180. 7 \n2 Risk factors \nIn this section, a number of risk factors are illustrated, both risks pertaining to the Company and the Group and risk linked to the Bonds in their capacity of financial instruments. The risk factors are organised in categories and the most material risk factor in a category is presented first, where the materiality has been determined based on the probability of occurrence and expected magnitude of negative impact of the risk. Subsequent risk factors in the same category are not ranked in order of materiality or probability of occurrence. \nRisks related to the Issuer's business activities and industry \nPolitical risks \nThe Group operates in a number of countries, such as Botswana, Colombia, Ghana, Mexico, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, which are subject to greater political, economic and social uncertainties than countries with more developed institutional structures, which means that the Group is subject to significant political risks. As a result thereof, unforeseeable and unfavourable changes in legislation or other regulations regarding, e.g., foreign ownership, state participation, taxes, allocation of licenses and concessions, customs duties, exchange rates, interest rates and fees, insurance pricing and reforms, enforcement processes, payroll deductions, deposit taking and other regulatory matters may occur in one or more countries of operation. There is a risk that such events and political instability in any country where the Group operates, as well as the Company’s failure to protect against such risks, will require the Group to discontinue existing products, services, business models or the businesses altogether in the affected countries. Such consequences would adversely affect the Group’s income statement via reduced sales, lower interest income and higher impairment charges and the balance sheet via high provisions and potential covenant breaches on debt funding. The Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising wholly or partially in one country in the ordinary course to be high. If the above risk were to materialise in one country, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low but if multiple instances occur in rapid succession, then the impact moves to high. \nLoss of a deduction code \nAt source loans, which are loans deducted at source, is the Group’s most significant business segment and are offered in all countries in which the Group operates. As at 30 September 2019, at source loans amounted to approximately 99.3 per cent. of total assets of the Group. The Group relies on the ability to collect directly from the payroll of its customers in order to service the outstanding loans, which is facilitated through deduction codes. The Company is allocated a deduction code to be able to collect directly from an employee’s (the borrower’s) payroll. The loss of a deduction code would result in any new loans to customers needing to be collected via an alternative mechanism other than payroll. Depending on the terms of the deduction code agreement, existing loans would either continue to be collected off the payroll until such time as they have been paid off in full or directly from the client’s bank account via direct debit. Without the Company’s possibility to collect directly from the borrower’s payroll there is a risk that the company would need to re-price the loan offerings due to the increased collection risk and that the number of non-performing loans on these new loans would increase from today’s average level of 5.1 per cent. of non-performing loans. Such consequences would adversely affect the Group’s income statement in terms of loss of revenue and potentially higher impairment charges and the balance sheet in terms of increase in non-performing loans resulting in the need for greater provisions. \nThe Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high if the code relates to a central government deduction in a large subsidiary and low if the code relates to a branch of government or a private employer. 8 \nCompetition \nThe Group currently has a large number of competitors and is exposed to risks relating to competition. Occasionally, a competitor in a single market may try and undercut pricing in that market for a period of time in order to gain market share. Historically, there have been instances where such measures have been taken by competitors and if this was to continue for sustained periods, Bayport would have to adjust pricing in order to compete which would impact profitability to varying degrees depending on the extent and frequency of the price reductions. If the Group fails to successfully compete due to, e.g., less attractive loan terms or less efficient collection of outstanding matured loans than competitors, it could result in loss of market shares and customers or require price reductions or changes of the Group’s business model. Materialisation of such risks would adversely impact both the income statement in terms of quantum and growth of profitability and the balance sheet in terms of the loan book growth and potentially higher impairments. It is the Company’s assessment that the probability of the risks relating significant loss of earnings due to failure to compete with other at source lenders is medium. If such risks were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be medium. \nReputational risk \nThe Group’s business is dependent the trust and confidence of customers, lenders (including bondholders) suppliers and other stakeholders. Given the importance of access to financing in the local communities where the Group operates, the Group is expected to maintain high standards of social responsibility and to refrain from illegal and immoral activities, for example corruption. There is a risk that any damage to the reputation or reduced trust for the Group will have an adverse effect on the Group’s ability to attract or retain future funding for its operations, which would result in more expensive costs for capital and, in extension, an adverse effect on the Group’s financial position. Moreover, the Group’s relations with the local financial and regulatory authorities are of significant importance, since the Group companies’ operations are, to a large extent, dependent on concessions, licenses, permits and other decisions of such authorities. There is a risk that any damage to the reputation or trust in the Group will render such concessions, licenses, permits and other decisions more difficult, or impossible, to obtain and that negative impact on the Group’s income statement via reduced sales and profitability and the balance sheet via funding constraints. The Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low. \nInternal control risks \nRisk related to personnel \nThe Group’s success is reliant on its ability to recruit, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees at every level of its organisation and within the different business areas. Loss of key persons with special expertise relating to the Group and its respective fields of business or a significant loss of other employees could undermine the efficiency, financial position and profitability of the Group’s operations and replacement of such key persons or employees could be costly and time consuming. Competition for skilled staff in the Group’s different business areas is high and may increase in the future since the Group is continuingly growing in existing markets as well as potentially expanding into new markets and there is always a high demand for skilled labour in the markets where the Group operates. The loss of key persons or a failure by the Group to recruit, motivate, develop and retain highly skilled employees could lead to higher labour costs as well as disruptions in the Group’s operations, development and continued growth, which would negatively impact the income statement with potentially lower revenues and higher operating costs resulting in reduced profitability. \nFurther, insufficient in-house training would result in a significant risk for the Group’s operations, particularly with respect to management and key operational areas such as the credit and collections environments. In addition, the Group is exposed to the risk of wilful legal breach or neglect of regulations by its employees. Fraud and other improper actions by employees are not uncommon within the financial sector and there have been instances of such behaviour in Group companies. There is a risk that insufficient training or improper behaviour will negatively affect the Group’s reputation (see “Reputational risk” above) and lead to time and cost consuming legal processes, 9 \nwhich would adversely affect the Group’s income statement via reduced growth and on the balance sheet through high impairments should collections be negatively impacted. \nThe Company considers the probability of the above risks materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low. \nIT-system and technology \nThe Group’s operations are dependent on a number of information and data-processing systems for inter alia sales, administration, distribution, internal control. The Group operates four primary debtor management systems, a Group Accounting and Finance system and a number of function-specific support systems (e.g. Fraud management, CRM, Information security etc.). The Group deploys these systems, in terms of network and infrastructure architecture, in a generally consistent and standardised manner, although provision is made for local/regional differences in terms of regulations, infrastructure maturity and costs. The Company is exposed to the risk of failure of IT-systems or that technology strategies are not interrogated and updated. The risk of IT failure is a primary inherent risk especially with changes in business requiring flexible IT solutions. Errors in network servers, malware or other causes of disruptions such as localised power failures or complete failure of IT systems could damage the operations and cause material financial losses and liability in relation to customers as well as harm the reputation and market trust in the Group. Such consequences would have negative impact on the income statement via impact on new sales and any resulting costs from liabilities in relation to issues arising with customers. The Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low. \nLegal and regulatory risks \nLicense requirements and legislation \nIn most countries of operation, the Group is dependent on various licenses, concessions and other permits or permissions from local authorities (including but not limited to money licenses, business licenses, insurance licenses, credit and savings licenses) to conduct its business, and the Group will likely be required to obtain new licenses and/or permits in other jurisdictions in the future. If the Group is unable to obtain or retain necessary licenses and/or permits for a specific jurisdiction, it could be time-consuming to renew such existing licenses and permits or to apply for new licenses and permits and result in diversion of management’s attention from existing core business. It could also negatively affect the Group’s revenue and operations since it could become unlawful for the Group to conduct its business in one or more jurisdictions. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising to be low. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high. \nThe regulation in the financial services and insurance sectors is continuously changing in different geographical markets. New stricter laws and regulations relating to, inter alia, banking, insurance, credit and savings, acquisition and tax laws and/or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations, in some or all of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, may become more burdensome and costly for the Group to monitor certain national rules may limit the Group’s operations. Regulatory change is constant, and on the increase, requiring steadfast monitoring of relevant developments. Compliance to these regulations is imperative to ensure that operating licenses are maintained. There is a risk that adoption of new legislation, regulations, legal or administrative proceedings or changes in the judicial application will force the Group to change or discontinue existing products, services, businesses or business models or incur significant expenses or liabilities or prohibit the Group to carry on the licensed operations. Furthermore, there is a risk that inspections and supervision from authorities will lead to penal charges or ultimately that licenses or concessions will be withdrawn. If the Group breaches regulatory requirements or does not implement any such regulation properly or within certain timeframes it could lead to the consequence of, for example, withdrawal of permits or licenses which could lead to disruptions in the Group’s operations and thereby have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising to be medium. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low. 10 \nRisks related to taxes \nThe Company pursues its operations in accordance with its interpretations of tax legislation, tax agreements and the requirements of the tax authorities concerned in a number of countries and are impacted by the applicable tax regulations at any time in these countries. There is a risk that the tax authorities of the countries concerned will perform assessments and issue rulings that deviate from the Company’s understanding or interpretation of the aforementioned laws, agreements and regulations. Further, the subjectivity in setting intra-group prices for transfer pricing provides tax authorities the opportunity to challenge these transactions relating to the areas of intra group financing and group support services. Interpretation differences in relation to double taxation agreements between various tax authorities, and those authorities differing in their own interpretations of the same clause, could result in the paying countries authorities imposing additional taxes such as withholding taxes. These additional taxes will be prevented from being claimed as foreign tax credits in the hands of the income recipient in the receiving country as their authority disagrees with the interpretation and resultant taxes from the paying country’s tax authority should not have been legally levied in the first place and is thus not a legal tax charge. This, and the aforementioned audits and reviews could result in Group companies being required to pay additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s income statement. \nThe Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising in respect of the Company’s operations wholly or partially to be high. However, if the tax structure and assumptions currently employed by the Company were required to be adversely adopted, the potential negative impact is deemed to be low. Furthermore, the likelihood of any adverse tax reassessment affecting an individual Group company is high but the impact would be low for the Group at large. However, if a number of Group companies were to be adversely reassessed with respect to tax, the likelihood of which is very low but the impact is deemed to be medium. \nRisks related to the processing of personal data \nThe Group relies on personal data to provide its product offering to potential and existing customers. This data includes contact, employment and financial information. The Group’s ability to obtain, retain, share and otherwise process this customer data and other personal data is governed by data protection legislation, privacy requirements, agreements and other regulatory restrictions. The Group’s compliance with applicable data protection legislation is primarily supervised by the respective data protection authorities in the countries in which the Group operates. \nThere is a risk that the Group’s routines and systems for processing of customer data and other personal data are insufficient and, for example, do not prevent disclosure or processing of personal data in breach of applicable legislation or relevant agreements. If the Group fails, or is deemed to have failed, to protect and process personal data in compliance with applicable legislation and relevant agreements, this could result in, for example, the imposing of sanctions on the Company, criminal charges, monetary fines, reputational damages, the Group having", "label": [[453, 1012, "DefineIssuerName"], [24, 140, "DefineInstrumentFirstAmount"], [9468, 10094, "DefineInstrumentFirstAmount"], [19090, 19204, "DefineDenomination"], [1013, 1230, "DefineInstrumentMaxAmount"]]}

Riksbanken) on its website (www.riksbank.se). If no such rate is available, the most recently published rate shall be used instead. \n(c) A notice shall be deemed to be sent by way of press release if it is made available to the public within Sweden promptly and in a non-discriminatory manner. \n(d) No delay or omission of the Agent or of any Bondholder to exercise any right or remedy under the Finance Documents shall impair or operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy. \n(e) The privacy notice and any other information contained in this document before the table of contents section do not form part of these Terms and Conditions and may be updated without the consent of the Bondholders and the Agent. 12 \n2. Status of the Bonds \n(a) The Bonds are denominated in Swedish Kronor and each Bond is constituted by these Terms and Conditions. The Issuer undertakes to make payments in relation to the Bonds and to comply with these Terms and Conditions. \n(b) By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Bondholder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such agreement. \n(c) The nominal amount of each Bond is SEK 1,250,000 (the \"Nominal Amount\"). The total nominal amount of the Initial Bonds is SEK 550,000,000. All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of one hundred (100) per cent. of the Nominal Amount. \n(d) The minimum permissible investment in the Initial Bond Issue is SEK 1,250,000. \n(e) Provided that the Incurrence Test is met, the Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds (each such issue, a \"Subsequent Bond Issue\").

The maximum Total Nominal Amount of the Bonds (the Initial Bonds and all Subsequent Bonds) may not exceed SEK 1,000,000,000 unless a consent from the Bondholders is obtained in accordance with Clause 15(e)(i). Each Subsequent Bond shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 8(a), and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Bonds. \n(f) The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank (i) without any preference among them and (ii) at least pari passu with all direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, except those obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law. \n(g) The Bonds are freely transferable but the Bondholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable, under local laws to which a Bondholder may be subject. Each Bondholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense. \n(h) No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds. 13 \n3. Use of Proceeds \n(a) The proceeds from the Initial Bond Issue shall be used to: \n(i) refinance the Refinancing Debt; \n(ii) finance general corporate purposes, including investments and acquisitions; and \n(iii) finance Transaction Costs. \n(b) The proceeds from any Subsequent Bond Issue shall be used to: \n(i) finance general corporate purposes, including investments and acquisitions; and \n(ii) finance Transaction Costs. \n4.

The Agent does not have any obligation to review the documentation and evidence referred to in Clause 4(a) and 4(b) above from a legal or commercial perspective of the Bondholders. \n(d) The Agent shall confirm to the Issuing Agent when it is satisfied that the conditions in Clause 4(a) or 4(b), as the case may be, have been fulfilled (or amended or waived in accordance with Clause 18 (Amendments and Waivers).

{"id": 27285, "data": "NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OFFERING MEMORANDUM IN THE UNITED STATES \nPetroleum Geo-Services ASA $150,000,000 7.375% Senior Notes due 2018 \nPetroleum Geo-Services ASA, a company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway (the “Compa- ny”), is offering $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.375% Senior Notes due 2018 (the “Additional Notes”) as additional notes under an indenture dated November 15, 2011 (the “Indenture”). On November 15, 2011, the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes due 2018 (the “Original Notes” and, together with the Additional Notes, the “Notes”). The Original Notes and the Additional Notes will constitute a single class of debt securities under the Indenture and will vote as a single class for purposes of amendments or waivers under the Indenture. \nInterest on the Additional Notes will be payable semi-annually on each June 15 and December 15, beginning on June 15, 2013. Prior to December 15, 2015, the Company may redeem the Notes at the applicable make-whole premium described in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). In addition, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes prior to December 15, 2014 with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. At any time on or after December 15, 2015, the Company may redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a specific premium to you as set forth in this Offering Memorandum. The Company may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes in the event of certain developments affecting taxation, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a change of control, each holder may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Notes will mature on De- cember 15, 2018. \nThe Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, senior obligations of the Company and will rank equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior debt of the Company. The Original Notes are, and the Addi- tional Notes will be, guaranteed (the “Guarantees”), jointly and severally, on a senior basis by the subsidiaries of the Com- pany (other than the subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of Egypt) that guarantee its existing senior credit facility (collectively, the “Guarantors”). Each Guarantee ranks equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor. The Notes and Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s and the Guar- antors’ existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and to all existing and future debt of all of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. \nThis Offering Memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes and Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants and transfer restrictions. \nThis Offering Memorandum constitutes a prospectus of the Luxembourg Law dated July 10, 2005 on Prospectuses for Securities, as amended.

Industry publications general- ly state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accura- cy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have not independently verified such data. \nIn many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, govern- ment bodies or other organizations) to validate market-related analyses and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding our position in the industry, our market share and the market shares of various industry participants based on experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our review of industry publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors. While the Company has examined and relied upon certain market or other industry data from external sources as the basis of its esti- mates, neither the Company nor the Initial Purchaser has verified that data independently. Similarly, while the Company believes its internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent sources and the Company and the Initial Purchaser cannot assure you as to their accuracy. Unless otherwise indicat- ed, data on the Company’s market position and market share are based on the Company’s best estimate. The Com- pany’s estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors. Therefore, the Company takes responsibility for the correct reproduction and extraction of such information, but neither the Initial Purchaser nor the Company can assure you of, or take responsibility for, the accuracy and completeness of such da- ta. \nTRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES \nWe own or have rights to trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business. In addition, our name, logo and website name and address are our service marks or trademarks. Each trademark, trade name or service mark by any other company appearing in this Offering Memorandum belongs to its holder.

These forward- looking statements include, but are not limited to, the discussion of the changing dynamics of the industry in which the Company competes and the demand for the Company’s prod- ucts and services. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “aim”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “continue”, “could”, “estimates”, “expects”, “forecasts”, “guid- ance”, “intends”, “may”, “plan”, “should” or “will” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or compara- ble terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition and performance, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate. \nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking state- ments are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or sug- vi gested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are con- sistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: \n• the level of capital expenditures by the oil and gas industry and changes in demand for seismic prod- ucts and services; \n• our ability to convert backlog into revenues and our clients’ ability to unilaterally terminate certain contracts in our backlog; \n• the effects of competition and related pricing pressures due to excess capacity; \n• the seasonal nature of our revenues; \n• the costs of compliance with governmental regulation, including environmental, health and safety laws; \n• market developments affecting, and other changes in, the demand for seismic data and related services; \n• the social, political and economic risks of our global operations, including tax liabilities; \n• our ability to fully recover our investments in our MultiClient library; \n• fluctuations in amounts we amortize from our MultiClient library; \n• our high fixed costs; \n• exposure to foreign exchange rate risk; \n• our ability to finance our operations on acceptable terms; \n• exposure to fluctuations in fuel costs; \n• technological obsolescence of our equipment and software; \n• difficulties and costs in protecting intellectual property rights and exposure to infringement claims by others; \n• the effects of weather or other delays on our operations; \n• ongoing operational risks and our ability to have adequate insurance against such risks; \n• any impairment of our deferred tax assets; \n• our dependence on a small number of significant clients; \n• any disruption or adverse event affecting our key operational suppliers; \n• strikes or other labor disruptions; \n• our ability to attract and retain senior management and highly skilled employees; vii • shorter than anticipated service life of our vessels; and \n• our substantial leverage and restrictions in our debt agreements that could impair our activities. \nThe foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date here- of. We urge you to read this Offering Memorandum, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors”, “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and “Business”, for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we operate. \nExcept as required by law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which the Notes are listed, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attribut- able to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including those set forth under “Risk Fac- tors.” \nCERTAIN DEFINITIONS \nAs used in this Offering Memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings: \n“Board” refers to the board of directors of the Company. \n“Company” or “PGS” refers to Petroleum Geo-Services ASA. \n“Credit Agreement” refers to the $950,000,000 Credit Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2007, as amended by an amendment dated May 21, 2010 and as may be further amended, supplemented, amended and restated or oth- erwise modified to the date hereof, among Petroleum Geo-Services ASA and PGS Finance, Inc. as Borrowers, the other guarantors party thereto, Barclays Capital and UBS Securities LLC, as Term Loan Arrangers and Bookrun- ners, Barclays Capital, DNB Bank ASA, Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. and UBS Securities LLC as Revolving Cred- it Arrangers and Revolving Credit Lead Bookrunners, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as Term Loan Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, Barclays Bank PLC, as Revolving Credit Administrative Agent and Barclays Capital as Global Coordinator and Documentation Agent.

Under the new policy, the directly attributable costs incurred in connection with major overhaul activities are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated period until the next similar overhaul. The former poli- cy was to expense such costs when incurred. The change is made to better reflect the economic reality, reduce vola- tility and align the accounting to industry practice and practice among other vessel owning companies. The change principally reduces cost of sales and increases depreciation and amortization expense. The change in policy has been applied for all reported periods, including periods prior to January 1, 2011. For a presentation of adjustments made in the restated periods, see Note 36 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. \nIn addition, with effect from January 1, 2012, we amended our method for calculating amortization by in- troducing more amortization categories. Previously we categorized each MultiClient survey into one of four amorti- zation categories with amortization rates of 90%, 75%, 60% or 45% of sales. Each category was comprised of sur- veys for which the remaining book value as a percentage of estimated remaining sales is less than or equal to the amortization rate applicable to that category. Based on our experience these broad categories could cause large swings in amortization rates, particularly for surveys that fell at the bottom of the range of a higher amortization category. In order to more precisely report amortization, we have introduced 5% intervals ranging from 30-95% of sales amounts, with a minimum of 45% for pre-funding. The change will lead, on average, to less rounding up when calculating amortization. \nThe financial information included in this Offering Memorandum includes some measures which are not accounting measures within the scope of IFRS. As used in this Offering Memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings: \n“EBITDA” means income (loss) before income tax expense before currency exchange gain (loss), other fi- nancial expense, other financial income, interest expense, income (loss) from associated companies, other operating income, impairments of long-lived assets and depreciation and amortization. \n“EBITDA margin” means EBITDA for the period divided by revenue for that period. \n“Marine Contract EBIT margin” means the Marine Contract operating profit, excluding impairments and unusual items, for the period divided by Marine Contract revenue for the period. \n“net debt” means long-term and short-term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt and gross of deferred loan costs) less cash and equivalents. \n“net interest bearing debt” means long-term and short-term debt (including the current portion of long-term", "label": [[71, 139, "DefineIssuerName"], [141, 249, "DefineIssuerIncorperationPlace"], [34033, 34128, "DefineAgent"], [30597, 30652, "DefineIssuerName"], [1882, 1926, "DefineInstrumentMaturityDate"]]}

{"id": 27292, "data": "- 1 - PRICING SUPPLEMENT \nPROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS: The Securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (\"MiFID II\"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (\"IMD\"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the \"Prospectus Directive\"). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the \"PRIIPs Regulation\") for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. Notwithstanding the above, if the Issuer subsequently prepares and publishes a key information document under the PRIIPs Regulation in respect of the Securities, then the prohibition on the offering, sale or otherwise making available the Securities to a retail investor as described above shall no longer apply. \nMiFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Securities (a \"distributor\") should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer‘s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. \nPricing Supplement dated 20 November 2018 \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. \nStructured Products Programme for the issuance of Notes, Warrants and Certificates \n(the \"Programme\") \nSEK 120,000,000 10-Year Fixed Coupon Notes, due November 2028 (the \"Securities\" or the \"Notes\") \nThe offering circular dated 25 April 2018 and the Supplement(s) to the offering circular listed in the Annex hereto (as so supplemented, the \"Offering Circular\") (as completed and (if applicable) amended by this Pricing Supplement) has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Securities in any Member State of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a \"Relevant Member State\") will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive, as implemented in that Relevant Member State, from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Securities. The expression \"Prospectus Directive\" means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including by Directive 2010/73/EU), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that Relevant Member State of the Securities may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any Dealer to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor any Dealer has authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of the Securities in any other circumstances. - 2 - The Securities will not be offered, sold or otherwise distributed in or from Switzerland and neither this Pricing Supplement nor any other document relating to the Securities may be distributed in or from Switzerland in connection with any such offering or distribution, except to individually selected qualified investors within the meaning of, and in accordance with, the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes. \nIf you purchase the Securities described in this Pricing Supplement after the date hereof, you should review the most recent restatement (if any) of the Offering Circular and each supplement thereafter up to (and including) the date of purchase to ensure that you have the most up to date information on the Issuer and (if applicable) the Guarantor on which to base your investment decision (note that the terms and conditions of the Securities will remain as described in this Pricing Supplement and the version of the Offering Circular described above, subject to any amendments notified to the Holder). Each supplement and restatement (if any) to the Offering Circular can be found on (www.bourse.lu) and (www.ise.ie). \nRISK FACTORS \nPurchase of the Securities involves substantial risks \nInvestors should ensure that they understand the nature of the risks posed by, and the extent of their exposure under, the Securities. Investors should make all pertinent inquiries they deem necessary without relying on the Issuer or the Dealer. Investors should consider the suitability of the Securities as an investment in light of their own circumstances, investment objectives, tax position and financial condition. Investors should consider carefully all the information set forth in this Pricing Supplement along with all the information set forth in the Offering Circular. Investors should pay particular attention to the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in the Offering Circular (pages 30 to 110 inclusive). \nUnregulated Securities: The Securities does not constitute a participation in a collective investment scheme within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes and are not subject to supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA \nThe Securities do not constitute a participation in a collective investment scheme within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes and the Securities is not subject to approval, registration or supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA or any other regulatory authority in Switzerland. Accordingly, investors do not have the benefit of the specific investor protection provided under the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes and are exposed to the credit risk of the Issuer. \nU.S. insolvency and resolution considerations \nNew York Law Notes constitute \"loss-absorbing capacity\" within the meaning of the final rules (the \"TLAC rules\") issued by the Federal Reserve on 15 December 2016 regarding, among other things, the minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity that certain U.S. bank holding companies, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., will be required to maintain, commencing 1 January 2019. Such debt must satisfy certain eligibility criteria under the TLAC rules. If JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to enter into resolution, either in a proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or into a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, holders of New York Law Notes and other debt and equity securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (including other Securities issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co.) will absorb the losses of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates. \nUnder Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a detailed plan (the \"resolution plan\") for the rapid and orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its material subsidiaries under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of material financial distress or failure. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s preferred resolution strategy under its resolution plan contemplates that only JPMorgan Chase & Co. would enter bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code pursuant to a \"single point of entry\" recapitalisation strategy. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s subsidiaries would be recapitalised as - 3 - needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s equity securities and thereafter on unsecured creditors, including holders of New York Law Notes and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (including other Securities issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co.). Claims of holders of New York Law Notes and such other debt securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Accordingly, in a resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, holders of New York Law Notes and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (including other Securities issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co.) would realise value only to the extent available to JPMorgan Chase & Co. as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been fully repaid. If JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to enter into resolution, none of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s preferred resolution strategy under its resolution plan. \nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalisation model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. Pursuant to that strategy, the FDIC would use its power to create a \"bridge entity\" for JPMorgan Chase & Co.; transfer the systemically important and viable parts of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity; recapitalise those subsidiaries using assets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. that have been transferred to the bridge entity; and exchange external debt claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co. for equity in the bridge entity. Under this Title II resolution strategy, the value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of New York Law Notes and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (including other Securities issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co.) may not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such New York Law Notes and other securities. To date, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy, and it is not obligated to follow such a strategy in a Title II resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. \nPART A – CONTRACTUAL TERMS \nTerms used herein shall be deemed to be defined as such for the purposes of the General Conditions and the Specific Product Provisions (as may be amended and/or supplemented up to, and including, the Issue Date) set forth in the Offering Circular.

The modifier 1 indicates that the \nobligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category.” \nS&P Global Ratings has, in its January 2021 publication “S&P Global Ratings Definitions” described \na rating of “A” in the following terms: “An obligation rated 'A' is somewhat more susceptible to the \nadverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher- \nrated categories.

The documents incorporated by reference above have been filed with Euronext Dublin. 4 PRICING TERMS \n[The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank] 5 Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. \nThe Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor (and, for the avoidance of doubt, this means any retail investor within or outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United Kingdom (the “UK”)). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “Retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended). \nNo key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. \nPricing Terms \ndated 3 June 2020 \nSingle Platform Investment Repackaging Entity SA \n(a public limited liability company (société anonyme) incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg with registered office at 51, avenue John F.
