The nature of BP2F's business makes it particularly sensitive to market and macroeconomic conditions in Europe, which have been at times challenging and volatile in recent years. \nIn 2015, the global economic activity remained sluggish. Activity slowed down in emerging countries, while a modest recovery continued in developed countries. The global outlook is still impacted by three major transitions: the diminished economic growth in China, the fall in prices of energy and other commodities, and an initial tightening of US monetary policy in a context of resilient internal recovery, while the central banks of several major developed countries are continuing to ease their monetary policies. For 2016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is forecasting the progressive recovery of global economic activity (1) but with low growth prospects on the medium term in developed and emerging countries. \nWhile the exposure of the BNP Paribas Group in emerging countries is limited, the vulnerability of these economies may generate disruptions in the global financial system that could affect the BNP Paribas Group (including BNPPF) and potentially alter its results. \nIn numerous emerging economies, an increase in foreign currency commitments was observed in 2015, while the levels of indebtedness (both in foreign and local currencies) are already high. Moreover, the prospects of a progressive hike in key rates in the United States (first rate increase decided by the Federal Reserve in December 2015), as well as heightened financial volatility linked to the concerns regarding growth in emerging countries, have contributed to \n(1) See: IMF – October 2015 Financial Stability Report, Advanced Countries and January 2016 update \n0109619-0000005 ICM:24505977.1 - 14 - \nthe stiffening of external financial conditions, capital outflows, further currency depreciations in numerous emerging countries and an increase in risks for banks. This could lead to the downgrading of sovereign ratings. \nGiven the possible standardisation of risk premiums, there is a risk of global market disruptions (rise in risk premiums, erosion of confidence, decline in growth, postponement or slowdown in the harmonisation of monetary policies, drop in market liquidity, problem with the valuation of assets, shrinking of the credit offering, and chaotic de-leveraging) that would affect all banking institutions. \nThe continuation of a situation with exceptionally low interest rates could promote excessive risk-taking by certain financial players: increase in the maturity of loans and assets held, less stringent loan granting policies, increase in leverage financing. \nSome players (insurance companies, pension funds, asset managers, etc.) entail an increasingly systemic dimension and in the event of market turbulence (linked for instance to a sudden rise in interest rates and/or a sharp price correction) they may decide to unwind large positions in an environment of relatively weak market liquidity. \nSuch liquidity pressure could be exacerbated by the recent increase in the volume of assets under management placed with structures investing in illiquid assets. \nLaws and Regulations Applicable to Financial Institutions. \nLaws and regulations applicable to financial institutions that have an impact on BNPPF have significantly evolved in the wake of the global financial crisis. The measures that have been proposed and/or adopted in recent years include more stringent capital and liquidity requirements (particularly for large global banking groups such as the BNP Paribas Group), taxes on financial transactions, restrictions and taxes on employee compensation, limits on the types of activities that commercial banks can undertake and ring- fencing or even prohibition of certain activities considered as speculative within separate subsidiaries, restrictions on certain types of financial products, increased internal control and reporting requirements, more stringent conduct of business rules, mandatory clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, requirements to mitigate risks in relation to over-the-counter derivative transactions and the creation of new and strengthened regulatory bodies. \nThe measures that were recently adopted, or in some cases proposed and still under discussion, that have or are likely \n0109619-0000005 ICM:24505977.1 - 15 - \nto affect BNPPF, include in particular the EU Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements \"CRD IV\" dated 26 June 2013 and many of whose provisions have been applicable since 1 January 2014; the proposals of technical regulatory and execution rules relating to the Directive and Regulation CRD IV published by the EBA; the Belgian Banking Law dated 25 April 2014 replacing the previous law of 1993 and introducing important changes; the Belgian Royal Decree dated 22 February 2015 determining the entry into force of the Belgian Banking Law provisions relating to resolution (including the establishment of a Belgian Resolution Authority) and creating two preferential rights on the bank's movables; the Belgian Royal Decree dated 18 December 2015 amending the law of 25 April 2014 on the status and supervision of credit institutions and the Royal Decree of 26 December 2015 amending the law of 25 April \n2014 on the status and supervision of credit institutions relating to the resolution and recovery of group failures; both Royal Decrees being ratified by the Act of 27 June 2016; the public consultation for the reform of the structure of the EU banking sector of 2013 and the European Commission's proposed regulation on structural measures designed to improve the strength of EU credit institutions of 29 January 2014; Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014; the European Single Supervisory Mechanism; the European Single Resolution Mechanism dated 15 July 2014 and the European Directive on Bank Recovery and Resolution dated 15 May 2014; the European Directive on Revised Deposit Guarantee Schemes dated 16 April 2014; the final rule for the regulation of foreign banks imposing certain liquidity, capital and other prudential requirements adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve; the proposal of the U.S. Federal Reserve relating to liquidity ratios of large banks; and the \"Volcker\" Rule imposing certain restrictions on investments in or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds and proprietary trading activities (of U.S. banks and to some extent non-U.S. banks) that was recently adopted by the U.S. regulatory authorities. More generally, regulators and legislators in any country may, at any time, implement new or different measures that could have a significant impact on the financial system in general or BNPPF in particular. \n0109619-0000005 ICM:24505977.1 - 16 - \nB.5 Description of the Group BNP Paribas (\"BNPP\") is a European leading provider of banking and financial services and has four domestic retail banking markets in Europe, namely in Belgium, France, Italy and Luxembourg.

The nature of BP2F's business makes it particularly sensitive to market and macroeconomic conditions in Europe, which have been at times challenging and volatile in recent years. \nIn 2015, the global economic activity remained sluggish. Activity slowed down in emerging countries, while a modest recovery continued in developed countries. The global outlook is still impacted by three major transitions: the diminished economic growth in China, the fall in prices of energy and other commodities, and an initial tightening of US monetary policy in a context of resilient internal recovery, while the central banks of several major developed countries are continuing to ease their monetary policies. For 2016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is forecasting the progressive recovery of global economic activity (1) but with low growth prospects on the medium term in developed and emerging countries. \nWhile the exposure of the BNP Paribas Group in emerging countries is limited, the vulnerability of these economies may generate disruptions in the global financial system that could affect the BNP Paribas Group (including BNPPF) and potentially alter its results. \nIn numerous emerging economies, an increase in foreign currency commitments was observed in 2015, while the levels of indebtedness (both in foreign and local currencies) are already high. Moreover, the prospects of a progressive hike in key rates in the United States (first rate increase decided by the Federal Reserve in December 2015), as well as heightened financial volatility linked to the concerns regarding growth in emerging countries, have contributed to \n(1) See: IMF – October 2015 Financial Stability Report, Advanced Countries and January 2016 update \n0109619-0000005 ICM:24505977.1 - 14 - \nthe stiffening of external financial conditions, capital outflows, further currency depreciations in numerous emerging countries and an increase in risks for banks. This could lead to the downgrading of sovereign ratings. \nGiven the possible standardisation of risk premiums, there is a risk of global market disruptions (rise in risk premiums, erosion of confidence, decline in growth, postponement or slowdown in the harmonisation of monetary policies, drop in market liquidity, problem with the valuation of assets, shrinking of the credit offering, and chaotic de-leveraging) that would affect all banking institutions. \nThe continuation of a situation with exceptionally low interest rates could promote excessive risk-taking by certain financial players: increase in the maturity of loans and assets held, less stringent loan granting policies, increase in leverage financing. \nSome players (insurance companies, pension funds, asset managers, etc.) entail an increasingly systemic dimension and in the event of market turbulence (linked for instance to a sudden rise in interest rates and/or a sharp price correction) they may decide to unwind large positions in an environment of relatively weak market liquidity. \nSuch liquidity pressure could be exacerbated by the recent increase in the volume of assets under management placed with structures investing in illiquid assets. \nLaws and Regulations Applicable to Financial Institutions. \nLaws and regulations applicable to financial institutions that have an impact on BNPPF have significantly evolved in the wake of the global financial crisis. The measures that have been proposed and/or adopted in recent years include more stringent capital and liquidity requirements (particularly for large global banking groups such as the BNP Paribas Group), taxes on financial transactions, restrictions and taxes on employee compensation, limits on the types of activities that commercial banks can undertake and ring- fencing or even prohibition of certain activities considered as speculative within separate subsidiaries, restrictions on certain types of financial products, increased internal control and reporting requirements, more stringent conduct of business rules, mandatory clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, requirements to mitigate risks in relation to over-the-counter derivative transactions and the creation of new and strengthened regulatory bodies. \nThe measures that were recently adopted, or in some cases proposed and still under discussion, that have or are likely \n0109619-0000005 ICM:24505977.1 - 15 - \nto affect BNPPF, include in particular the EU Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements \"CRD IV\" dated 26 June 2013 and many of whose provisions have been applicable since 1 January 2014; the proposals of technical regulatory and execution rules relating to the Directive and Regulation CRD IV published by the EBA; the Belgian Banking Law dated 25 April 2014 replacing the previous law of 1993 and introducing important changes; the Belgian Royal Decree dated 22 February 2015 determining the entry into force of the Belgian Banking Law provisions relating to resolution (including the establishment of a Belgian Resolution Authority) and creating two preferential rights on the bank's movables; the Belgian Royal Decree dated 18 December 2015 amending the law of 25 April 2014 on the status and supervision of credit institutions and the Royal Decree of 26 December 2015 amending the law of 25 April \n2014 on the status and supervision of credit institutions relating to the resolution and recovery of group failures; both Royal Decrees being ratified by the Act of 27 June 2016; the public consultation for the reform of the structure of the EU banking sector of 2013 and the European Commission's proposed regulation on structural measures designed to improve the strength of EU credit institutions of 29 January 2014; Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014; the European Single Supervisory Mechanism; the European Single Resolution Mechanism dated 15 July 2014 and the European Directive on Bank Recovery and Resolution dated 15 May 2014; the European Directive on Revised Deposit Guarantee Schemes dated 16 April 2014; the final rule for the regulation of foreign banks imposing certain liquidity, capital and other prudential requirements adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve; the proposal of the U.S. Federal Reserve relating to liquidity ratios of large banks; and the \"Volcker\" Rule imposing certain restrictions on investments in or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds and proprietary trading activities (of U.S. banks and to some extent non-U.S. banks) that was recently adopted by the U.S. regulatory authorities. More generally, regulators and legislators in any country may, at any time, implement new or different measures that could have a significant impact on the financial system in general or BNPPF in particular. \n0109619-0000005 ICM:24505977.1 - 16 - \nB.5 Description of the Group BNP Paribas (\"BNPP\") is a European leading provider of banking and financial services and has four domestic retail banking markets in Europe, namely in Belgium, France, Italy and Luxembourg.

Stockmann filed an application for corporate restructuring proceedings (the “Restructuring Proceedings”) at the Helsinki District Court on 6 April 2020. A restructuring programme was approved for Stockmann on 9 February 2021 (the “Restructuring Programme”), which is being implemented by Stockmann as at the date of this Prospectus. The Restructuring Programme has been restated with the decision of the Helsinki Disctrict Court on 17 May 2021. Any references to the Restructuring Programme in this Prospectus shall be construed as references to the Restructuring Programme as it has been approved by the court from time to time. The Restructuring Proceedings have come to an end with the approval of the Restructuring Programme on 9 February 2021. Pursuant to the Restructuring Programme, the holders of Unsecured Debt (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) are entitled to convert 80 per cent. of their receivables under the Unsecured Debt, by way of set-off, to senior secured bonds (the “Bonds”) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the bond issue (the “Terms and Conditions of the Bonds”) described in this Prospectus (the “Offering”).

The Bonds are dematerialised securities registered in the Finnish book-entry system maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd. The currency of the Bonds is the euro. The Bonds are issued in denominations of EUR 1. The ISIN of the Bonds is FI4000507330. The Bonds bear interest at a fixed interest rate of 0.10 per cent. per annum. Interest on the Bonds will be payable biannually in arrears commencing on 5 January 2022. Each Bond will be freely transferable once it has been registered into the respective book-entry account. The maturity of the Bonds is on the date falling five (5) years after the First Issue Date (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) unless the Issuer prepays or redeems the Bonds before their maturity. \nThe Bonds are secured by the Transaction Security (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds). The Transaction Security secures a major part of the other indebtedness of the Issuer, of which the majority is debts under the Restructruring Programme. Future indebtedness permitted under the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds will also share the Transaction Security. Certain liabilities also have priority to the proceeds from the enforcement of Transaction Security. \nThe aggregate amount of the Initial Bonds (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) may be an amount of up to 80 per cent. of the Unsecured Debt (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds). All Initial Bonds are issued at an issue price of 100 per cent. of the Nominal Amount (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds). \nThe Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds). Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Bonds. The aggregate amount of the Subsequent Bonds will be an amount of (i) up to 80 per cent. of the Unsecured Debt (for the avoidance of doubt, that at the time of the First Issue Date remains as Disputed Restructuring Debt (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) and other than the Remaining Restructuring Creditors (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) under the Remaining Restructuring Debt (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) which have decided not to use their right of set-off in accordance with the Restructuring Programme) and (ii), in case the Permitted Working Capital Financing (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) has been incurred in the form of Subsequent Bonds, EUR 50,000,000. \nWhere Will the Securities Be Traded? \nThe Issuer will submit a listing application to the Helsinki Stock Exchange to list the Bonds on the official list of the Helsinki Stock Exchange with the trading code “STCJ001026”. In the event the Bonds are so listed, upon any issue of Subsequent Bonds, the Issuer shall promptly after the relevant issue date procure that the volume of Bonds listed is increased accordingly. \nWhat Are the Key Risks That Are Specific to the Securities? \n A failure of the Offering could lead to the lapse of the Company’s Restructuring Programme and the investors losing their investment partially or in full.  Investors may forfeit interest and principal amount invested.  The Transaction Security may be susceptible to recovery.  The Transaction Security may not be sufficient to cover all the obligations secured thereby, the enforcement of the security may be delayed and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Transaction Security may be restricted by local law. \nKey Information on the Offer of Securities \nUnder Which Conditions and Timetable Can I Invest in This Security? \nThe Bonds are offered for subscription to the Unsecured Creditors (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) in order to convert, by way of set-off, the Unsecured Debt into Bonds. Subscription shall be made by submitting a duly completed subscription form to Evli Bank Plc by the end of the subscription period. The subscription period of the Offering commences 24 May 2021 at 10:00 Finnish time and ends on 18 June 2021 at 16:00 Finnish time unless the subscription period is extended. By returning such duly completed subscription form to Evli Bank Plc by the end of the subscription period, the relevant Unsecured Creditor irrevocably confirms its willingness to subscribe for Bonds in the amount of 80 per cent. of the Unsecured Debt owed by the Issuer to the relevant Unsecured Creditor. After the final allocation of the subscriptions by the Issuer, each Unsecured Creditor that has submitted a subscription shall be notified by the Issuer when such subscription is accepted. Subscriptions notified by the Issuer as having been accepted shall be paid for in kind by way of set-off against the Unsecured Debt owed by the Issuer to the relevant Unsecured Creditor, as instructed in connection with the subscription. Bonds subscribed for shall be entered by the Issuing Agent (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) to the respective book-entry accounts of the subscribers on a date advised in connection with the issuance of the Bonds in accordance with the Finnish legislation governing book-entry system and book-entry accounts as well as regulations and decisions of the central securities depository. \nIn connection with the Offering, the Issuer expects to pay approximately a total of EUR 0.5 million in fees and expenses. No fees or other payments will be charged to the investor by the Issuer. \nWhy Is This Prospectus Being Produced? \nThis Prospectus is being produced in order to enable the Offering and the conversion of the Unsecured Debt into Bonds as required by the Restructuring Programme and to apply for the trading of the Bonds on the official list of the Helsinki Stock Exchange. The purpose of the issuance of the Initial Bonds is to convert, by way of set-off, up to 80 per cent. of the Unsecured Debt of Unsecured Creditors that have decided to use their right of set-off in accordance with the Restructuring Programme. \nMaterial Interests \nThe interests of the Lead Arranger are normal business interests in the financial markets. The Lead Arranger and its respective affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, advisory, consulting and/or banking services for Stockmann in the ordinary course of their business for which they have received, or will receive, customary fees and expenses.

Concepts and terms defined in the Terms and Conditions are used with the same meaning in this Prospectus unless otherwise is explicitly understood from the context. \nThis Prospectus has been approved and registered by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Sw.

The SFSA only approves this Prospectus as meeting the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and consistency imposed by the Prospectus Regulation. The SFSA’s approval should not be considered as an endorsement of the Company that is the subject of this Prospectus, nor should it be considered as an endorsement of the quality of the Bonds. Investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing in the Bonds. Any information contained on websites accessible through hyperlinks in this Prospectus does not form part of the prospectus and has not been scrutinised or approved by the SFSA, unless such information is incorporated by reference in this Prospectus. \nThis Prospectus is not an offer for sale or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Bonds in any jurisdiction.

Such forward- looking statements and information are based on the beliefs of the Company’s management or are assumptions based on information available to the Group. The words “considers”, “intends”, “deems”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “plans” and similar expressions indicate some of these forward- looking statements.

Any forward-looking statements in this Prospectus involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performances or achievements of the Group to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Further, such forward- looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the Group’s present and future business strategies and the environment in which the Group will operate in the future. Although the Company believes that the forecasts or indications of future results, performances and achievements are based on reasonable assumptions and expectations, they involve uncertainties and are subject to certain risks, the occurrence of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements and from past results, performances or achievements. Further, actual events and financial outcomes may differ significantly from what is described in such statements as a result of the materialisation of risks and other factors affecting the Group’s operations. Such factors of a significant nature are mentioned in section 2 “Risk factors”. \nThis Prospectus shall be read together with all documents that are incorporated by reference (see section 8 “Documents incorporated by reference” and possible supplements to this Prospectus. \nThe Bonds may not be a suitable investment for all investors and each potential investor in the Bonds must determine the suitability of that investment in light of his or her own circumstances.

The Group operates in countries subject to greater political, economic and social uncertainties than countries with more developed institutional structures. As a result thereof, unforeseeable and unfavourable changes in legislation or other regulations may occur in one or more countries of operation. There is a risk that such events and political instability in any country where the Group operates, as well as the Company’s failure to protect against such risks, will require the Group to discontinue existing products, services, business models or the businesses altogether in the affected countries. The Company considers the probability of such risk materialising wholly or partially in one country in the ordinary course to be high. If the above risk were to materialise in one country, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low but if multiple instances occur in rapid succession, then the impact moves to high. Loss of a deduction code. As at 30 September 2019, at source loans amounted to approximately 99.3 per cent. of the total assets of the Group. The Group relies on the ability to collect directly from the payroll of its customers in order to service the outstanding loans, which is facilitated through deduction codes. The Company is allocated a deduction code to be able to collect directly from an employee’s (the borrower’s) payroll. Loss of a deduction code would necessitate any new loans to be collected via an alternative mechanism other than payroll. Without the Company’s possibility to collect directly from the borrower’s payroll there is a risk that the Company would need to re-price the loan offerings due to the increased collection risk and that the number of non-performing loans on such new loans would increase from today’s average level of 4.8 per cent. of non-performing loans. The Company considers the probability of such risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high if the code relates to a central government deduction in a large subsidiary and low if the code relates to a branch of government or a private employer. License requirements. In most countries of operation, the Group is dependent on various licenses, concessions and other permits or permissions from local authorities to conduct its business, and the Group will likely be required to obtain new licenses and/or permits in other jurisdictions in the future. If the Group is unable to obtain or retain necessary licenses and/or permits, it could be time-consuming to renew such existing licenses and permits or to apply for new licenses and permits and result in diversion of management’s attention from existing core business. It could also negatively affect the Group’s revenue and operations since it could become unlawful for the Group to conduct its business in one or more jurisdictions. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising to be low. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high. Currency risks. The Group’s results of operations are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Since the consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in USD, the Group also faces a currency translation risk to the extent that the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company or its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than USD. Consequently, there is a risk that fluctuations in the value of the USD versus local currencies of the Company or its subsidiaries will affect the amount of these items in the Group’s consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in the original currency. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising to be high. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high. \nKey information on the securities \nWhat are the main features of the securities? \nSecurities Eight hundred (800) Bonds were issued in the Bond Issue, each Bond with a nominal amount of USD 100,000. The Bonds are debt instruments with ISIN NO0010871601 registered under Norwegian law and intended for public trading. The Bonds, including the obligation to pay interest thereon, constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer. The rights and claims of the holders in respect of the Bonds against the Issuer are subordinated in right of payment to any present or future claims of all unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer. 6 \nThe Bonds bear interest from (and including) the relevant issue date up to (but excluding) the relevant redemption date. Any subsequent bonds will carry interest from (and including) the interest payment date falling immediately prior to their issuance up to (but excluding) the relevant redemption date. The interest rate is a fixed rate of 10.50 per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on 19 June and 19 December each year or, to the extent such day is not a business day, the first following day that is a business day. \nWhere will the securities be traded? \nAdmission to trading The Bonds will be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Stockholm Sustainable Bond List or, if such admission to trading is not possible to attain or obtain, at another regulated market. \nWhat are the key risks that are specific to the securities? \nRisks Subordinated obligations. The Bonds are subordinated to all of the Company’s unsubordinated present and future debts. In the event the Company will be subject to any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, the Company will be required to pay all prioritised creditors and all unsubordinated creditors (including holders of any unsubordinated market debt) in full before the Company makes any payment on the Bonds. Due to the unsecured and subordinated nature of the Bonds there is a risk that an investor in the Bonds may lose all or part of its investment in the event of liquidation or insolvency of the Company. Dependency on Group companies. The Company holds no significant assets other than the shares in the Group companies. The Company is dependent on the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its Group companies, and their direct and indirect subsidiaries, sufficient to fulfil its payment obligations under the terms and conditions of the Bonds. The ability of the portfolio companies to make such payments to the Company is subject to, among other things, the profitability the Group companies and/or funds available therefrom, or legal or contractual restrictions on the upstreaming of cash. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high. \nKey information on the admission to trading on a regulated market \nWhy is this prospectus being produced? \nReasons and use of issue proceeds The Issuer has the intention and shall use its best efforts (without assuming any legal or contractual obligation) to ensure that the Bonds issued on the Issue Date are admitted to trading on Nasdaq Stockholm Sustainable Bond (or another regulated market) within thirty days after the Issue Date. This Prospectus has been prepared to enable the Bonds to be admitted to trading on such regulated market. \nThe net proceeds from the Bond Issue are to be used in accordance with the Social Bond Framework to finance general corporate purposes of the Group, including investments, acquisitions and repurchases of social bonds with ISIN NO0010856180. 7 \n2 Risk factors \nIn this section, a number of risk factors are illustrated, both risks pertaining to the Company and the Group and risk linked to the Bonds in their capacity of financial instruments. The risk factors are organised in categories and the most material risk factor in a category is presented first, where the materiality has been determined based on the probability of occurrence and expected magnitude of negative impact of the risk. Subsequent risk factors in the same category are not ranked in order of materiality or probability of occurrence. \nRisks related to the Issuer's business activities and industry \nPolitical risks \nThe Group operates in a number of countries, such as Botswana, Colombia, Ghana, Mexico, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, which are subject to greater political, economic and social uncertainties than countries with more developed institutional structures, which means that the Group is subject to significant political risks. As a result thereof, unforeseeable and unfavourable changes in legislation or other regulations regarding, e.g., foreign ownership, state participation, taxes, allocation of licenses and concessions, customs duties, exchange rates, interest rates and fees, insurance pricing and reforms, enforcement processes, payroll deductions, deposit taking and other regulatory matters may occur in one or more countries of operation. There is a risk that such events and political instability in any country where the Group operates, as well as the Company’s failure to protect against such risks, will require the Group to discontinue existing products, services, business models or the businesses altogether in the affected countries. Such consequences would adversely affect the Group’s income statement via reduced sales, lower interest income and higher impairment charges and the balance sheet via high provisions and potential covenant breaches on debt funding. The Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising wholly or partially in one country in the ordinary course to be high. If the above risk were to materialise in one country, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low but if multiple instances occur in rapid succession, then the impact moves to high. \nLoss of a deduction code \nAt source loans, which are loans deducted at source, is the Group’s most significant business segment and are offered in all countries in which the Group operates. As at 30 September 2019, at source loans amounted to approximately 99.3 per cent. of total assets of the Group. The Group relies on the ability to collect directly from the payroll of its customers in order to service the outstanding loans, which is facilitated through deduction codes. The Company is allocated a deduction code to be able to collect directly from an employee’s (the borrower’s) payroll. The loss of a deduction code would result in any new loans to customers needing to be collected via an alternative mechanism other than payroll. Depending on the terms of the deduction code agreement, existing loans would either continue to be collected off the payroll until such time as they have been paid off in full or directly from the client’s bank account via direct debit. Without the Company’s possibility to collect directly from the borrower’s payroll there is a risk that the company would need to re-price the loan offerings due to the increased collection risk and that the number of non-performing loans on these new loans would increase from today’s average level of 5.1 per cent. of non-performing loans. Such consequences would adversely affect the Group’s income statement in terms of loss of revenue and potentially higher impairment charges and the balance sheet in terms of increase in non-performing loans resulting in the need for greater provisions. \nThe Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high if the code relates to a central government deduction in a large subsidiary and low if the code relates to a branch of government or a private employer. 8 \nCompetition \nThe Group currently has a large number of competitors and is exposed to risks relating to competition. Occasionally, a competitor in a single market may try and undercut pricing in that market for a period of time in order to gain market share. Historically, there have been instances where such measures have been taken by competitors and if this was to continue for sustained periods, Bayport would have to adjust pricing in order to compete which would impact profitability to varying degrees depending on the extent and frequency of the price reductions. If the Group fails to successfully compete due to, e.g., less attractive loan terms or less efficient collection of outstanding matured loans than competitors, it could result in loss of market shares and customers or require price reductions or changes of the Group’s business model. Materialisation of such risks would adversely impact both the income statement in terms of quantum and growth of profitability and the balance sheet in terms of the loan book growth and potentially higher impairments. It is the Company’s assessment that the probability of the risks relating significant loss of earnings due to failure to compete with other at source lenders is medium. If such risks were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be medium. \nReputational risk \nThe Group’s business is dependent the trust and confidence of customers, lenders (including bondholders) suppliers and other stakeholders. Given the importance of access to financing in the local communities where the Group operates, the Group is expected to maintain high standards of social responsibility and to refrain from illegal and immoral activities, for example corruption. There is a risk that any damage to the reputation or reduced trust for the Group will have an adverse effect on the Group’s ability to attract or retain future funding for its operations, which would result in more expensive costs for capital and, in extension, an adverse effect on the Group’s financial position. Moreover, the Group’s relations with the local financial and regulatory authorities are of significant importance, since the Group companies’ operations are, to a large extent, dependent on concessions, licenses, permits and other decisions of such authorities. There is a risk that any damage to the reputation or trust in the Group will render such concessions, licenses, permits and other decisions more difficult, or impossible, to obtain and that negative impact on the Group’s income statement via reduced sales and profitability and the balance sheet via funding constraints. The Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low. \nInternal control risks \nRisk related to personnel \nThe Group’s success is reliant on its ability to recruit, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees at every level of its organisation and within the different business areas. Loss of key persons with special expertise relating to the Group and its respective fields of business or a significant loss of other employees could undermine the efficiency, financial position and profitability of the Group’s operations and replacement of such key persons or employees could be costly and time consuming. Competition for skilled staff in the Group’s different business areas is high and may increase in the future since the Group is continuingly growing in existing markets as well as potentially expanding into new markets and there is always a high demand for skilled labour in the markets where the Group operates. The loss of key persons or a failure by the Group to recruit, motivate, develop and retain highly skilled employees could lead to higher labour costs as well as disruptions in the Group’s operations, development and continued growth, which would negatively impact the income statement with potentially lower revenues and higher operating costs resulting in reduced profitability. \nFurther, insufficient in-house training would result in a significant risk for the Group’s operations, particularly with respect to management and key operational areas such as the credit and collections environments. In addition, the Group is exposed to the risk of wilful legal breach or neglect of regulations by its employees. Fraud and other improper actions by employees are not uncommon within the financial sector and there have been instances of such behaviour in Group companies. There is a risk that insufficient training or improper behaviour will negatively affect the Group’s reputation (see “Reputational risk” above) and lead to time and cost consuming legal processes, 9 \nwhich would adversely affect the Group’s income statement via reduced growth and on the balance sheet through high impairments should collections be negatively impacted. \nThe Company considers the probability of the above risks materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low. \nIT-system and technology \nThe Group’s operations are dependent on a number of information and data-processing systems for inter alia sales, administration, distribution, internal control. The Group operates four primary debtor management systems, a Group Accounting and Finance system and a number of function-specific support systems (e.g. Fraud management, CRM, Information security etc.). The Group deploys these systems, in terms of network and infrastructure architecture, in a generally consistent and standardised manner, although provision is made for local/regional differences in terms of regulations, infrastructure maturity and costs. The Company is exposed to the risk of failure of IT-systems or that technology strategies are not interrogated and updated. The risk of IT failure is a primary inherent risk especially with changes in business requiring flexible IT solutions. Errors in network servers, malware or other causes of disruptions such as localised power failures or complete failure of IT systems could damage the operations and cause material financial losses and liability in relation to customers as well as harm the reputation and market trust in the Group. Such consequences would have negative impact on the income statement via impact on new sales and any resulting costs from liabilities in relation to issues arising with customers. The Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising wholly or partially to be low. If the above risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low. \nLegal and regulatory risks \nLicense requirements and legislation \nIn most countries of operation, the Group is dependent on various licenses, concessions and other permits or permissions from local authorities (including but not limited to money licenses, business licenses, insurance licenses, credit and savings licenses) to conduct its business, and the Group will likely be required to obtain new licenses and/or permits in other jurisdictions in the future. If the Group is unable to obtain or retain necessary licenses and/or permits for a specific jurisdiction, it could be time-consuming to renew such existing licenses and permits or to apply for new licenses and permits and result in diversion of management’s attention from existing core business. It could also negatively affect the Group’s revenue and operations since it could become unlawful for the Group to conduct its business in one or more jurisdictions. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising to be low. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be high. \nThe regulation in the financial services and insurance sectors is continuously changing in different geographical markets. New stricter laws and regulations relating to, inter alia, banking, insurance, credit and savings, acquisition and tax laws and/or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations, in some or all of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, may become more burdensome and costly for the Group to monitor certain national rules may limit the Group’s operations. Regulatory change is constant, and on the increase, requiring steadfast monitoring of relevant developments. Compliance to these regulations is imperative to ensure that operating licenses are maintained. There is a risk that adoption of new legislation, regulations, legal or administrative proceedings or changes in the judicial application will force the Group to change or discontinue existing products, services, businesses or business models or incur significant expenses or liabilities or prohibit the Group to carry on the licensed operations. Furthermore, there is a risk that inspections and supervision from authorities will lead to penal charges or ultimately that licenses or concessions will be withdrawn. If the Group breaches regulatory requirements or does not implement any such regulation properly or within certain timeframes it could lead to the consequence of, for example, withdrawal of permits or licenses which could lead to disruptions in the Group’s operations and thereby have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations. The Company considers the probability of the risk materialising to be medium. If the risk were to materialise, the Company considers the potential negative impact to be low. 10 \nRisks related to taxes \nThe Company pursues its operations in accordance with its interpretations of tax legislation, tax agreements and the requirements of the tax authorities concerned in a number of countries and are impacted by the applicable tax regulations at any time in these countries. There is a risk that the tax authorities of the countries concerned will perform assessments and issue rulings that deviate from the Company’s understanding or interpretation of the aforementioned laws, agreements and regulations. Further, the subjectivity in setting intra-group prices for transfer pricing provides tax authorities the opportunity to challenge these transactions relating to the areas of intra group financing and group support services. Interpretation differences in relation to double taxation agreements between various tax authorities, and those authorities differing in their own interpretations of the same clause, could result in the paying countries authorities imposing additional taxes such as withholding taxes. These additional taxes will be prevented from being claimed as foreign tax credits in the hands of the income recipient in the receiving country as their authority disagrees with the interpretation and resultant taxes from the paying country’s tax authority should not have been legally levied in the first place and is thus not a legal tax charge. This, and the aforementioned audits and reviews could result in Group companies being required to pay additional taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s income statement. \nThe Company considers the probability of the above risk materialising in respect of the Company’s operations wholly or partially to be high. However, if the tax structure and assumptions currently employed by the Company were required to be adversely adopted, the potential negative impact is deemed to be low. Furthermore, the likelihood of any adverse tax reassessment affecting an individual Group company is high but the impact would be low for the Group at large. However, if a number of Group companies were to be adversely reassessed with respect to tax, the likelihood of which is very low but the impact is deemed to be medium. \nRisks related to the processing of personal data \nThe Group relies on personal data to provide its product offering to potential and existing customers. This data includes contact, employment and financial information. The Group’s ability to obtain, retain, share and otherwise process this customer data and other personal data is governed by data protection legislation, privacy requirements, agreements and other regulatory restrictions. The Group’s compliance with applicable data protection legislation is primarily supervised by the respective data protection authorities in the countries in which the Group operates. \nThere is a risk that the Group’s routines and systems for processing of customer data and other personal data are insufficient and, for example, do not prevent disclosure or processing of personal data in breach of applicable legislation or relevant agreements. If the Group fails, or is deemed to have failed, to protect and process personal data in compliance with applicable legislation and relevant agreements, this could result in, for example, the imposing of sanctions on the Company, criminal charges, monetary fines, reputational damages, the Group having", "label": [[453, 1012, "DefineIssuerName"], [24, 140, "DefineInstrumentFirstAmount"], [9468, 10094, "DefineInstrumentFirstAmount"], [19090, 19204, "DefineDenomination"], [1013, 1230, "DefineInstrumentMaxAmount"]]}

Should the CSD, due to a delay on behalf of the Issuer or some other obstacle, not be able to effectuate payments as aforesaid, the Issuer shall procure that such amounts are paid as soon as possible after such obstacle has been removed. \n8.3 If, due to any obstacle for the CSD, the Issuer cannot make a payment or repayment, such payment or repayment may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed. Interest shall accrue in accordance with Clause 9.4 during such postponement. \n8.4 If payment or repayment is made in accordance with this Clause 8, the Issuer and the CSD shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligation to pay, irrespective of whether such payment was made to a Person not entitled to receive such amount. \n8.5 The Issuer shall pay any stamp duty and any other public fees accruing in connection with the Initial Bond Issue and any Subsequent Bond Issue, but not in respect of trading in the secondary market (except to the extent required by applicable law), and shall deduct at source any applicable withholding tax payable pursuant to law.

This prospectus has not been approved or disapproved by, or registered with, the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet) nor the Norwegian Registry of Business Enterprises. \nThe Notes described herein have not been and will not be offered or sold to the public in Norway, and no offering or marketing materials relating to the Notes may be made available or distributed in any way that would constitute, directly or indirectly, an offer to the public in Norway. This prospectus is for the recipient only and may not in any way be forwarded to any other person or to the public in Norway. \nGENERAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE LUXEMBOURG STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING \nNIB has obtained all necessary consents, approvals and authorizations in connection with the issuance and performance of the Notes. Resolutions of the Board of Directors of NIB, dated December 14, 2006, December 16, 2010, December 11, 2014, December 10, 2015 and October 3, 2016, authorized the issuance of the Notes and related matters. \nNIB has applied to list the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in accordance with the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange pursuant to the Luxembourg Prospectus Act. Copies of the 2004 Agreement and all reports prepared and filed are available at the office of BNP Paribas Securities Services, Luxembourg Branch, the listing agent in Luxembourg. \nSo long as any of the Notes remain outstanding and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, copies (and English translations for documents not in English) of the following items will be available free of charge from NIB’s listing agent at its offices at 60 avenue J.F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg: \n• all incorporated documents that are considered part of this pricing supplement; \n• the audited annual financial statements of NIB; \n• future annual financial reports of NIB; and \n• any related notes to these items. \nDuring the same period, the Fiscal Agency Agreement will be available for inspection at the office of BNP Paribas Securities Services, Luxembourg Branch in Luxembourg. NIB will, until the repayment of the Notes, maintain a paying agent in Luxembourg, which initially will be BNP Paribas Securities Services, Luxembourg Branch. Payments on book-entry Notes that clear through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may be effected through the Luxembourg paying agent. BNP Paribas Securities Services, Luxembourg Branch will also serve as transfer agent in Luxembourg. \nP-7 \nIf any payment on a Note presented for payment in Luxembourg is due on a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulations to be closed in Luxembourg, such payment will be made on the next Luxembourg Business Day (a day, other than Saturday or Sunday, which is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulations to be closed in Luxembourg). This payment will be treated as if it were made on the due date, and no additional interest will accrue as a result of this delay. \nNotices to holders of the Notes will be made by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the registered holders. Notices concerning the Notes will also be made by publication in a leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or by publication on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s website (www.bourse.lu). In particular, notices relating to any redemption permitted under the terms of the Notes and relating to interest rates will be notified to the Luxembourg paying agent and the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Any notice will be deemed to have been given on the date of publication or, if published more than once, on the date of first publication. \nNIB is not involved in any litigation or arbitration proceedings relating to claims or amounts which are material in the context of the issuance of the Notes nor, so far as NIB is aware, is any such litigation or arbitration pending or threatened. Except as disclosed in this pricing supplement, the prospectus supplement and the prospectus and the documents considered part of them, there has been no material adverse change in the financial position or prospects of NIB since December 31, 2015. \nUNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS \nThe Notes will be issued in a “qualified reopening” and therefore will be part of the same issue and have the same “issue price” for U.S. federal income tax purposes as NIB’s outstanding NOK 2,400,000,000 1.375% notes due July 15, 2020. For a discussion of U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to you if you invest in the Notes, see “United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. \nThe following paragraph is added on page S-42 of the accompanying prospectus supplement, following the section “United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Holders—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding”: \nReportable Transactions \nA U.S. taxpayer that participates in a “reportable transaction” will be required to disclose its participation to the IRS. Under the relevant rules, if the notes are denominated in a foreign currency, a U.S. holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the regulations ($50,000 in a single taxable year if the U.S. holder is an individual or trust, or higher amounts for other non-individual U.S. holders), and to disclose its investment by filing Form 8886 with the IRS. A penalty in the amount of $10,000 in the case of a natural person and $50,000 in all other cases is generally imposed on any taxpayer that fails to timely file an information return with the IRS with respect to a transaction resulting in a loss that is treated as a reportable transaction. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules. \nP-8 \nFiled Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) Registration No. 333-203363 \nPROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT (To Prospectus dated June 17, 2015) \nNordic Investment Bank \nU.S. $20,000,000,000 \nMedium-Term Notes, Series D Due Nine Months or More from Date of Issue \nThe following terms may apply to the notes, which Nordic Investment Bank may sell from time to time.

You should carefully read the pricing supplement relating to the terms and conditions of a particular issue of notes along with this entire prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. \nIssuer: Nordic Investment Bank. \nAgents: Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. \nFiscal Agent: Citibank, N.A. \nPaying Agent: Citibank, N.A. \nExchange Rate Agent: Citibank, N.A. \nCalculation Agent: Citibank, N.A. \nSpecified Currencies: Including, but not limited to, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, euro, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollars, Pounds Sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs and U.S. dollars or any other currency specified in the applicable pricing supplement. \nAmount: Up to a principal amount, or initial offering price in the case of indexed notes and discount notes, in aggregate for all indebtedness of NIB in Series D outstanding at any one time of $20,000,000,000 or its equivalent in other currencies, of which only the total dollar amount registered with the SEC (or the equivalent in other currencies) may be offered and sold in connection with offers and sales in the United States. \nIssue Price: The notes may be issued at par, or at a premium over, or discount to, par and either on a fully paid or partly paid basis. \nMaturities: The notes will mature at least nine months from their date of issue. \nFixed Rate Notes: Fixed rate notes will bear interest at a fixed rate. \nFloating Rate Notes: Floating rate notes will bear interest at a rate determined periodically by reference to one or more interest rate bases plus a spread or multiplied by a spread multiplier. \nIndexed Notes: Payments on indexed notes will be calculated by reference to a specific measure or index, as specified in the applicable pricing supplement. \nDiscount Notes: Discount notes are notes that are offered or sold at a price less than their principal amount and called discount notes in the applicable pricing supplement. They may or may not bear interest. \nRedemption and Repayment: If the notes are redeemable at the option of NIB or repayable at the option of the holder before maturity, the pricing supplement will specify: \nS-4 \n• the initial redemption date on or after which NIB may redeem the notes or the repayment date or dates on which the holders may elect repayment of the notes; \n• the redemption or repayment price; and \n• the required prior notice to the holders or NIB. \nStatus: The notes will constitute direct, unconditional and unsecured indebtedness of NIB and will rank equal in right of payment among themselves and with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of NIB. \nTaxes: NIB will make all payments on the notes without gross-up for any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges whatsoever. \nFurther Issues: NIB may from time to time, without the consent of existing holders, create and issue notes having the same terms and conditions as any other outstanding notes offered pursuant to a pricing supplement in all respects, except for the issue date, issue price and, if applicable, the first payment of interest thereon. Additional notes issued in this manner will be consolidated with, and will form a single series with, any such other outstanding notes. \nListing: Application has not been made to list the notes on an exchange. Any particular issue of notes may be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or elsewhere, as provided in the applicable pricing supplement. NIB is under no obligation to list any issued notes and may in fact not do so. \nStabilization: In connection with the issue and distribution of any tranche of notes made under this program, a stabilizing manager disclosed in the applicable pricing supplement or any person acting for the stabilizing manager may over-allot or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the notes of such tranche or the series of which such tranche forms a part issued under this program at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail for a limited period after the issue date. However, there may be no obligation of the stabilizing manager or any agent of the stabilizing manager to do this. Any such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time, and must be brought to an end after a limited period. Such stabilizing shall be in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules. \nGoverning Law: The notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, New York law, except for authorization and execution of the notes by NIB and any other matters required to be governed by the 2004 Agreement and the Statutes of NIB, as amended. \nPurchase Currency: You must pay for notes by wire transfer in the specified currency. You may ask an agent to arrange for, at its discretion, the conversion of U.S. dollars or another currency into the specified currency to enable you to pay for the notes. You must make this request on or before the fifth Business Day preceding the issue date, or by a later date if the agent allows. The agent will set the terms for each conversion and you will be responsible for all currency exchange costs. \nWarrants: If NIB issues warrants, it will describe the specific terms relating to the warrants in the applicable pricing supplement. \nS-5 \nCertain Risk Factors: For information about risks associated with investments in the notes, especially foreign currency notes and indexed notes, see “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-7. \nS-6 \nRISK FACTORS \nYour investment in the notes entails risks. This section describes certain risks associated with investing in the notes and, in particular, foreign currency notes and indexed notes. The applicable pricing supplement may describe additional risks. Such notes are not an appropriate investment for persons who are unsophisticated with respect to foreign currency transactions or the type of index or formula used to determine amounts payable on the notes. You should consult your financial and legal advisors about the risks of investing in the notes and the suitability of your investment in light of your particular situation. NIB disclaims any responsibility for advising you on these matters. \nNIB’s credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in the notes. \nThe credit ratings of NIB’s medium-term note program may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure and other factors on any trading market for, or the trading value of, the notes. In addition, real or anticipated changes in NIB’s credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, the notes. \nAny decline in NIB’s credit ratings may affect the market value of your notes. \nNIB’s credit ratings are an assessment of its ability to pay its obligations, including those on the offered notes. Consequently, actual or anticipated declines in NIB’s credit ratings may affect the market value of your notes. \nEarly redemption may adversely affect your return on the notes. \nIf the notes are redeemable at NIB’s option, NIB may choose to redeem the notes at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. In addition, if the notes are subject to mandatory redemption, NIB may be required to redeem the notes also at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you generally will not be able to re-invest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the notes being redeemed. The existence of redemption features may also affect the market value of your notes. \nThere may not be any trading market for the notes; many factors affect the trading market and value of the notes. \nNIB cannot assure you a trading market for the notes will ever develop or be maintained. Unless the applicable pricing supplement states otherwise, your notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or be included in any interdealer market quotation system. As a result, there may be little or no secondary market for your notes. Even if a secondary market for your notes develops, it may not provide significant liquidity and NIB expects the transaction costs in any secondary market will be high. As a result, the differences between bid and ask prices for your notes in any secondary market could be substantial. In the case of indexed notes, many other factors, in addition to our own creditworthiness, may affect the trading market value of, and trading market for, the notes. See “—Risks Associated with Indexed Notes.” \nNotes issued under NIB’s Environmental Bond program are not “asset-backed” securities. \nThe proceeds from notes issued as part of NIB’s Environmental Bond (“NEB”) program are directed primarily to the funding of selected loans to finance projects that are considered to enhance the environment in NIB’s Member Countries. Payment of principal of and interest on such notes is made solely on the credit standing of NIB as a single institution and is not directly linked to the performance of environmental lending projects. Accordingly, such notes neither constitute “asset-backed” securities, nor are they otherwise credit- \nS-7 \nlinked to any of NIB’s environmental lending projects, and you should not look to any assets or pool of assets as providing enhanced credit support in respect of such notes. \nForeign Currency Risks \nNotes denominated in, or indexed to, a currency other than the currency of your home country are not an appropriate investment for you if you do not have experience with foreign currency transactions. \nIf NIB offers a note denominated in, or indexed to, a currency other than U.S. dollars, the applicable pricing supplement will contain information about the currency, including historical exchange rates and any exchange controls affecting the currency. NIB will provide this information for your convenience only. Future fluctuations in exchange rates or exchange controls may be very different from past trends, and NIB will not advise you of any changes after the date of the applicable pricing supplement. In addition, if you reside outside the United States, special considerations may apply to your investment in the notes. You should consult financial and legal advisors in your home country to discuss matters that may affect your purchase or holding of, or receipt of payments on, the notes. \nFluctuations in currency exchange rates and the imposition of exchange controls could reduce the effective yield of the notes and result in a loss to you. \nAn investment in a note denominated in, or indexed to, a currency other than that of your home country (a “foreign currency note”) entails significant risks that are not associated with an investment in a non-indexed note denominated in the currency of your home country (“home country currency”). \nRates of exchange between your home country currency and the specified currency (or, in the case of a currency indexed note, the rate of exchange between the specified currency and the indexed currency or currencies or between two or more indexed currencies for such note) may fluctuate significantly, resulting in a reduced yield or loss to you on the notes. Significant changes in the rate of exchange between your home country currency and the specified currency for a foreign currency note (or, in the case of a currency indexed note, the rate of exchange between the specified currency and the indexed currency or currencies or between two or more indexed currencies for such note) during the term of any foreign currency note or currency indexed note may significantly reduce the equivalent value in your home country currency of any interest payable in respect of such note and, consequently, equivalent rate of return (expressed in your home country currency) on the equivalent amount in your home country currency you paid to purchase such note. Moreover, if at maturity the specified currency for such note has depreciated against your home country currency (or, in the case of a currency indexed note, if significant changes have occurred in the rate of exchange between the specified currency and the indexed currency or currencies or between two or more indexed currencies for such note), the equivalent value in your home country currency of the principal amount payable in respect of such note may be significantly less than the equivalent amount in your home country currency you paid to purchase such note. \nIn certain circumstances such changes could result in a net loss to you in so far as the value of the note is measured in terms of your home currency. If any currency indexed note is indexed to an indexed currency on a greater than one to one basis, the note will be leveraged and the percentage of the potential loss (or gain) to the investor as a result of the changes in exchange rates between currencies discussed above may be greater than the actual percentage of the change in the rate of exchange between your home country currency and the currency or currencies in which the note is denominated or to which it is indexed. \nForeign exchange rates can either be fixed by sovereign governments or float. Exchange rates of most economically developed nations are permitted to fluctuate in value relative to the U.S. dollar. National governments, however, rarely voluntarily allow their currencies to float freely in response to economic forces. Sovereign governments may use a variety of techniques, such as intervention by a country’s central \nS-8 \nbank or imposition of regulatory controls or taxes, to affect the rate of exchange of their currencies. Governments may also issue a new currency to replace an existing currency or alter the exchange rate by devaluation or revaluation of a currency. A special risk to you in purchasing notes denominated in a foreign currency is that their yield could be affected by these types of governmental actions. \nWhile the pricing supplement relating to any foreign currency notes or currency indexed notes may contain information concerning historical exchange rates for the relevant specified currency or indexed currency against the U.S. dollar or between indexed currencies, they are not necessarily indicative of future changes in rates. In recent years, rates of exchange between certain currencies have been highly volatile, and you should expect this volatility to continue in the future. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past, however, do not necessarily indicate future fluctuations. \nExchange controls could affect exchange rates and prevent NIB from paying you in the specified currency.", "label": [[155, 178, "DefineIssuerName"], [25565, 25595, "DefineIssuerName"], [363, 435, "DefineInstrumentMaturityDate"], [6286, 6314, "DefineInstrumentMaturityDate"], [6535, 6603, "DefineDenomination"], [6043, 6087, "DefineInstrumentFirstAmount"]]}

{"id": 27285, "data": "NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OFFERING MEMORANDUM IN THE UNITED STATES \nPetroleum Geo-Services ASA $150,000,000 7.375% Senior Notes due 2018 \nPetroleum Geo-Services ASA, a company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway (the “Compa- ny”), is offering $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.375% Senior Notes due 2018 (the “Additional Notes”) as additional notes under an indenture dated November 15, 2011 (the “Indenture”). On November 15, 2011, the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes due 2018 (the “Original Notes” and, together with the Additional Notes, the “Notes”). The Original Notes and the Additional Notes will constitute a single class of debt securities under the Indenture and will vote as a single class for purposes of amendments or waivers under the Indenture. \nInterest on the Additional Notes will be payable semi-annually on each June 15 and December 15, beginning on June 15, 2013. Prior to December 15, 2015, the Company may redeem the Notes at the applicable make-whole premium described in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). In addition, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes prior to December 15, 2014 with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. At any time on or after December 15, 2015, the Company may redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a specific premium to you as set forth in this Offering Memorandum. The Company may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes in the event of certain developments affecting taxation, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a change of control, each holder may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Notes will mature on De- cember 15, 2018. \nThe Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, senior obligations of the Company and will rank equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior debt of the Company. The Original Notes are, and the Addi- tional Notes will be, guaranteed (the “Guarantees”), jointly and severally, on a senior basis by the subsidiaries of the Com- pany (other than the subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of Egypt) that guarantee its existing senior credit facility (collectively, the “Guarantors”). Each Guarantee ranks equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor. The Notes and Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s and the Guar- antors’ existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and to all existing and future debt of all of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. \nThis Offering Memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes and Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants and transfer restrictions. \nThis Offering Memorandum constitutes a prospectus of the Luxembourg Law dated July 10, 2005 on Prospectuses for Securities, as amended. The Original Notes are admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Additional Notes were made ready for delivery in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) for the account of its participants, including Euroclear Bank SA/NV and Clearstream Banking société anonyme, on December 27, 2012. \nInvesting in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 15. \nThe Additional Notes and the Guarantees thereof have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securi- ties Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”) or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Additional Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemp- tion from registration provided by Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) or in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”). You are hereby notified that sellers of the Addi- tional Notes may be relying on the exemption from Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.

Industry publications general- ly state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accura- cy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have not independently verified such data. \nIn many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, govern- ment bodies or other organizations) to validate market-related analyses and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding our position in the industry, our market share and the market shares of various industry participants based on experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our review of industry publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors. While the Company has examined and relied upon certain market or other industry data from external sources as the basis of its esti- mates, neither the Company nor the Initial Purchaser has verified that data independently. Similarly, while the Company believes its internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent sources and the Company and the Initial Purchaser cannot assure you as to their accuracy. Unless otherwise indicat- ed, data on the Company’s market position and market share are based on the Company’s best estimate. The Com- pany’s estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors. Therefore, the Company takes responsibility for the correct reproduction and extraction of such information, but neither the Initial Purchaser nor the Company can assure you of, or take responsibility for, the accuracy and completeness of such da- ta. \nTRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES \nWe own or have rights to trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business. In addition, our name, logo and website name and address are our service marks or trademarks. Each trademark, trade name or service mark by any other company appearing in this Offering Memorandum belongs to its holder. Some of the more important trademarks that we use include the RamformTM seismic vessels, GeoStreamer® \nequipment and services, MTEM® equipment and services, OptoSeis® equipment and services, and HD3D® seismic solution software, PGS hyperBeam® seismic solution software and services, and GeoSource™ equipment and ser- vices. \nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \nThis Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws of certain applicable jurisdictions. These forward- looking statements include, but are not limited to, the discussion of the changing dynamics of the industry in which the Company competes and the demand for the Company’s prod- ucts and services. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “aim”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “continue”, “could”, “estimates”, “expects”, “forecasts”, “guid- ance”, “intends”, “may”, “plan”, “should” or “will” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or compara- ble terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition and performance, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate. \nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking state- ments are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or sug- vi gested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are con- sistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: \n• the level of capital expenditures by the oil and gas industry and changes in demand for seismic prod- ucts and services; \n• our ability to convert backlog into revenues and our clients’ ability to unilaterally terminate certain contracts in our backlog; \n• the effects of competition and related pricing pressures due to excess capacity; \n• the seasonal nature of our revenues; \n• the costs of compliance with governmental regulation, including environmental, health and safety laws; \n• market developments affecting, and other changes in, the demand for seismic data and related services; \n• the social, political and economic risks of our global operations, including tax liabilities; \n• our ability to fully recover our investments in our MultiClient library; \n• fluctuations in amounts we amortize from our MultiClient library; \n• our high fixed costs; \n• exposure to foreign exchange rate risk; \n• our ability to finance our operations on acceptable terms; \n• exposure to fluctuations in fuel costs; \n• technological obsolescence of our equipment and software; \n• difficulties and costs in protecting intellectual property rights and exposure to infringement claims by others; \n• the effects of weather or other delays on our operations; \n• ongoing operational risks and our ability to have adequate insurance against such risks; \n• any impairment of our deferred tax assets; \n• our dependence on a small number of significant clients; \n• any disruption or adverse event affecting our key operational suppliers; \n• strikes or other labor disruptions; \n• our ability to attract and retain senior management and highly skilled employees; vii • shorter than anticipated service life of our vessels; and \n• our substantial leverage and restrictions in our debt agreements that could impair our activities. \nThe foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date here- of. We urge you to read this Offering Memorandum, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors”, “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and “Business”, for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we operate. \nExcept as required by law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which the Notes are listed, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attribut- able to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including those set forth under “Risk Fac- tors.” \nCERTAIN DEFINITIONS \nAs used in this Offering Memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings: \n“Board” refers to the board of directors of the Company. \n“Company” or “PGS” refers to Petroleum Geo-Services ASA. \n“Credit Agreement” refers to the $950,000,000 Credit Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2007, as amended by an amendment dated May 21, 2010 and as may be further amended, supplemented, amended and restated or oth- erwise modified to the date hereof, among Petroleum Geo-Services ASA and PGS Finance, Inc. as Borrowers, the other guarantors party thereto, Barclays Capital and UBS Securities LLC, as Term Loan Arrangers and Bookrun- ners, Barclays Capital, DNB Bank ASA, Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. and UBS Securities LLC as Revolving Cred- it Arrangers and Revolving Credit Lead Bookrunners, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as Term Loan Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, Barclays Bank PLC, as Revolving Credit Administrative Agent and Barclays Capital as Global Coordinator and Documentation Agent.

This Offering Memorandum also contains the unaudited consolidated financial in- formation of the Company as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2012 (the “Unaudited Con- solidated Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Consolidat- ed Financial Statements”). The Consolidated Financial Statements, together with the Company-Only Unconsolidat- ed Financial Statements, are referred to herein as the “Financial Statements.” The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”), the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Company- Only Unconsolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and generally accepted accounting standards and practices in Norway, and are presented in Norwegian kroner. \nThe unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2012 includ- ed in this Offering Memorandum was derived by adding the consolidated financial data for the year ended Decem- ber 31, 2011 to the unaudited consolidated financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and sub- tracting the unaudited consolidated financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The financial in- formation for the twelve months ended September 30, 2012 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any fu- ture date and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting. \nThe Company-Only Unconsolidated Financial Statements have been included in this Offering Memoran- dum because the independent auditor’s report issued on October 29, 2012 relating to the Audited Consolidated Fi- nancial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and2011 was also issued in respect of, and refers ix to, the Company-Only Unconsolidated Financial Statements as at December 31, 2010 and 2011 and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011. \nFrom January 1, 2011, we changed the policy for recognition of costs incurred in connection with major overhaul of vessels. Under the new policy, the directly attributable costs incurred in connection with major overhaul activities are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated period until the next similar overhaul. The former poli- cy was to expense such costs when incurred. The change is made to better reflect the economic reality, reduce vola- tility and align the accounting to industry practice and practice among other vessel owning companies. The change principally reduces cost of sales and increases depreciation and amortization expense. The change in policy has been applied for all reported periods, including periods prior to January 1, 2011. For a presentation of adjustments made in the restated periods, see Note 36 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. \nIn addition, with effect from January 1, 2012, we amended our method for calculating amortization by in- troducing more amortization categories. Previously we categorized each MultiClient survey into one of four amorti- zation categories with amortization rates of 90%, 75%, 60% or 45% of sales. Each category was comprised of sur- veys for which the remaining book value as a percentage of estimated remaining sales is less than or equal to the amortization rate applicable to that category. Based on our experience these broad categories could cause large swings in amortization rates, particularly for surveys that fell at the bottom of the range of a higher amortization category. In order to more precisely report amortization, we have introduced 5% intervals ranging from 30-95% of sales amounts, with a minimum of 45% for pre-funding. The change will lead, on average, to less rounding up when calculating amortization. \nThe financial information included in this Offering Memorandum includes some measures which are not accounting measures within the scope of IFRS. As used in this Offering Memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings: \n“EBITDA” means income (loss) before income tax expense before currency exchange gain (loss), other fi- nancial expense, other financial income, interest expense, income (loss) from associated companies, other operating income, impairments of long-lived assets and depreciation and amortization. \n“EBITDA margin” means EBITDA for the period divided by revenue for that period. \n“Marine Contract EBIT margin” means the Marine Contract operating profit, excluding impairments and unusual items, for the period divided by Marine Contract revenue for the period. \n“net debt” means long-term and short-term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt and gross of deferred loan costs) less cash and equivalents. \n“net interest bearing debt” means long-term and short-term debt (including the current portion of long-term", "label": [[71, 139, "DefineIssuerName"], [141, 249, "DefineIssuerIncorperationPlace"], [34033, 34128, "DefineAgent"], [30597, 30652, "DefineIssuerName"], [1882, 1926, "DefineInstrumentMaturityDate"]]}

For \nthe avoidance of doubt, the Rate of Interest payable on the Notes shall remain at \nuse the Initial Rate of Interest, notwithstanding any increase in the rating assigned to the \nNotes above Baa1/BBB+ (or equivalent); \n(B) if in the Interest Period ending on the date immediately prior to an Interest Payment \nDate: \n(a) either Rating Agency has announced a Step Up Rating Change, the Rate \nof Interest shall be adjusted such that the Rate of Interest, with effect from \nthe Interest Period commencing on such Interest Payment Date (subject to \npersonal any further adjustment pursuant to this Condition 6(g)), for each \nsubsequent Interest Period thereafter, will increase above the Initial Rate of \nInterest by an amount per Rating Agency equal to the percentage set out \nopposite the applicable lower rating of the Notes assigned by that Rating \nAgency in the table below: \nRating (or equivalent) Applicable percentage adjustment per Rating Agency \nBaa2/BBB 0.25 \nBaa3/BBB- 0.50 \nBa1/BB+ (or lower) 1.00 \nFor the avoidance of doubt, should one Rating Agency announce one or \nmore Step Up Rating Changes that in aggregate result in the rating \nassigned to the Notes by that Rating Agency being Ba2/BB or lower (or \nFor equivalent), no further increase in the Rate of Interest above the Initial Rate \nof Interest plus 1.00 per cent. shall occur in respect of Step Up Rating \nChanges announced by that Rating Agency. \nAccordingly, if one Rating Agency assigns a rating of Ba2/BB or lower (or \nequivalent), the Rate of Interest payable on the Notes shall be the Initial \nRate of Interest plus 1.00 per cent. If both Rating Agencies assign ratings \nof Ba2/BB or lower (or equivalent) the Rate of Interest payable on the \nNotes shall be the Initial Rate of Interest plus 2.00 per cent.; \n(b) either Rating Agency has announced a Step Down Rating Change which \nchange remains in effect on the relevant Interest Payment Date, the Rate of \nInterest shall be adjusted such that the Rate of Interest, with effect from the \nInterest Period commencing on such Interest Payment Date (subject to any \nfurther adjustment pursuant to this Condition 6(g)), for each subsequent \nInterest Period thereafter, will decrease by either: \n(i) 0.25 per cent. per notch per Rating Agency for each notch above the \nonly rating which is assigned by that Rating Agency to the Notes \nimmediately prior to the announced Step Down Rating Change (the \n“Base Rating”) if the Base Rating was at such time at Baa3/BBB- (or \nequivalent) or higher; or \n(ii) an initial 0.50 per cent. per Rating Agency if the Base Rating was at \nsuch time Ba1/BB+ (or equivalent) or lower plus an additional 0.25 \nper cent. per notch per Rating Agency for every notch the newly \nassigned rating is above Baa3/BBB- (or equivalent); \nuse until the Rate of Interest equals the Initial Rate of Interest (and for the \navoidance of doubt, the Rate of Interest shall never be less than the Initial \nRate of Interest); \n(C) if on any Interest Payment Date a credit rating is: \n(a) assigned to the Notes by only one Rating Agency (and for so long as this \nremains the case), any increase in the Rate of Interest of the Notes \npersonal necessitated by a reduction in the rating by that Rating Agency shall be \ntwice the applicable percentage set forth in this Condition 6(g)(i); or \n(b) not assigned to the Notes by both Rating Agencies, the Rate of Interest \napplicable to the Notes in respect of the Interest Period commencing on \nsuch Interest Payment Date shall be the Initial Rate of Interest plus 2.00 \nper cent. until such Interest Payment Date on which there is once more a \nrating assigned to the Notes by at least one Rating Agency whereupon, \nfrom and including such Interest Payment Date, the Rate of Interest shall \nbe determined in accordance with the provisions of this Condition 6(g)(i); \nand \n(D) if in any Interest Period one or more Step Down Rating Changes and/or Step Up \nRating Changes occurs, the Rate of Interest applicable to the next following Interest \nPeriod shall be determined based on the ratings in effect as at the end of such \nInterest Period; \n(ii) the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to maintain a credit rating for the Notes \nassigned by two Rating Agencies. If, notwithstanding such reasonable efforts, such Rating \nFor Agency or Rating Agencies fail to or cease to assign a rating to the Notes, the Issuer shall \nuse its reasonable endeavours to obtain a rating of the Notes from another Rating Agency \nor another two Rating Agencies, as the case may be, and references in this Condition 6 to \na Rating Agency, or the ratings assigned thereby, shall be to such Rating Agency or, as the \ncase may be, the equivalent ratings thereof; \n(iii) notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 6, there shall be no adjustment in the \nRate of Interest applicable to the Notes on the basis of any rating assigned to the Notes by \nany rating agency other than on a basis solicited by or on behalf of the Issuer even if at the \nrelevant time such rating is the only rating then assigned to the Notes; \n(iv) there shall be no limit on the number of times that adjustments to the Rate of Interest \npayable on the Notes may be made pursuant to this Condition 6 during the term of the \nNotes, provided always that at no time during the term of the Notes will the Rate of Interest \npayable on the Notes be less than the Initial Rate of Interest or more than the Initial Rate of \nonly Interest plus 2.00 per cent. per annum; and \n(v) the Issuer will cause the occurrence of an event giving rise to an adjustment in the Rate of \nInterest payable on the Notes pursuant to this Condition 6 to be notified to the Trustee and \nthe Principal Paying Agent and notice thereof to be given in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) as soon as possible after the occurrence of the relevant event but in no event \nlater than the fourth Business Day thereafter. \n(vi) In these Conditions: \nuse “Moody's” means Moody's Investors Service and its successors or affiliates; \n“Rating Agency” means each of S&P and Moody’s and, only in the event that the Notes \nhave ceased at any time to have a rating assigned to them by any of S&P and Moody's, \nany other credit rating agency of equivalent international standing specified from time to \ntime by the Issuer and, in each case, their respective successors or affiliates, and together, \nthe “Rating Agencies”; \n“S&P” means Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill \npersonal Companies, Inc. and its successors or affiliates; \n“Step Down Rating Change” means the public announcement by any Rating Agency \nassigning a credit rating to the Notes of an increase in, or confirmation of, a higher rating of \nthe Notes but does not include any increase or confirmation of credit rating where the \nincreased or confirmed credit rating is Ba1/BB+ (or equivalent) or lower; and \n“Step Up Rating Change” means the public announcement by any Rating Agency \nassigning a credit rating to the Notes of a decrease in, or confirmation of, a lower rating of \nthe Notes.” \nFor", "label": [[39, 161, "DefineIssuerName"], [829, 908, "DefineIssuerName"], [1643, 1670, "DefineInstrumentMaturityDate"], [1487, 1524, "DefineDenomination"], [1321, 1343, "DefineInstrumentMaxAmount"], [1350, 1373, "DefineInstrumentFirstAmount"], [1531, 1562, "DefineDenomination"]]}

Sie ist unwiderruflich, muss den für die Rückzahlung festgelegten Termin nennen und eine zusammenfassende Erklärung enthalten, welche die das Rückzahlungsrecht der Emittentin begründenden Umstände (der \"Kündigungsgrund\") darlegt; des weiteren ist eine Bescheinigung darüber beizufügen, dass es der Emittentin bzw., soweit sich der Kündigungsgrund auf nicht vermeidbare Zahlungen in Bezug auf die Garantie bezieht, der Garantin nach ihrem Ermessen nicht möglich ist, durch die Ergreifung angemessener, ihr zur Verfügung stehender Maßnahmen das Eintreten oder das Fortbestehen des Kündigungsgrundes zu vermeiden. \n(2) Vorzeitiger Rückzahlungsbetrag. \nFür die Zwecke von Absatz 1 des § 5 und § 9 ist der Vorzeitige Rückzahlungsbetrag der Rückzahlungsbetrag. \n§ 6 ZAHLUNGEN \n(1) (a) Zahlung auf Kapital. \nZahlungen auf Kapital in Bezug auf Schuldverschreibungen erfolgen nach Maßgabe des nachstehenden Absatzes 2 an das Clearingsystem oder dessen Order zur Gutschrift auf den Konten der jeweiligen Kontoinhaber des Clearingsystems gegen Vorlage und Einreichung der Globalurkunde bei der bezeichneten Geschäftsstelle einer der Zahlstellen außerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten. \n(b) Zahlung von Zinsen. \nDie Zahlung von Zinsen auf Schuldverschreibungen erfolgt nach Maßgabe des nachstehenden Absatzes 2 an das Clearingsystem oder dessen Order zur Gutschrift für die betreffenden Kontoinhaber des Clearingsystems. Zinszahlungen erfolgen nur außerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten. \nDie Zahlung von Zinsen auf durch eine vorläufige Globalurkunde verbriefte Schuldverschreibungen erfolgt nach Maßgabe des nachstehenden Absatzes 2 an das Clearingsystem oder dessen Order zur Gutschrift für die betreffenden Kontoinhaber des Clearingsystems nach ordnungsgemäßer Bescheinigung gemäß § 1 (3)(b). \n(2) Zahlungsweise. Vorbehaltlich geltender steuerlicher und sonstiger gesetzlicher Regelungen und Vorschriften erfolgen zu leistende Zahlungen auf Schuldverschreibungen in der Festgelegten Währung. \n(3) Vereinigte Staaten. Für die Zwecke des § 1 (3) und des Absatzes 1 dieses § 6 bezeichnet \"Vereinigte Staaten\" die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika (einschließlich deren Bundesstaaten und des District of Columbia) sowie deren Territorien (einschließlich Puerto Rico, die U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island und die Northern Mariana Islands). \n(4) Befreiung. Die Emittentin bzw. die Garantin wird durch Leistung der Zahlung an das Clearingsystem oder dessen Order von ihrer Zahlungspflicht befreit. \n(5) Zahltag. Fällt der Fälligkeitstag einer Zahlung in Bezug auf eine Schuldverschreibung auf einen Tag, der kein Zahltag ist, so ist der Gläubiger erst an dem nächstfolgenden Zahltag berechtigt, die Zahlung an diesem Ort zu verlangen und ist nicht berechtigt, weitere Zinsen oder sonstige Ausgleichszahlungen aufgrund dieser Verspätung zu verlangen. \nFür diese Zwecke bezeichnet \"Zahltag\" einen Tag (außer einem Samstag oder Sonntag), (i) an dem das Clearingsystem Zahlungen abwickelt, (ii) an dem Geschäftsbanken und Devisenmärkte Zahlungen in Oslo abwickeln und (iii) an dem alle betroffenen Bereiche des Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer systems 2 (\"TARGET\") offen sind, um Zahlungen abzuwickeln. \n(6) Bezugnahmen auf Zahlungen von Kapital und Zinsen. Bezugnahmen in diesen Anleihebedingungen auf Kapital der Schuldverschreibungen sollen, soweit anwendbar, folgende Beträge beinhalten: den Rückzahlungsbetrag der Schuldverschreibungen; den vorzeitigen Rückzahlungsbetrag der Schuldverschreibungen; und jeden Aufschlag sowie sonstige auf oder in Bezug auf die \nSchuldverschreibungen zahlbare Beträge. \nBezugnahmen in diesen Anleihebedingungen auf Zinszahlungen auf Schuldverschreibungen sollen, soweit anwendbar, sämtliche gemäß § 8 zahlbaren Zusätzlichen Beträge einschließen. \n(7) Hinterlegung von Kapital und Zinsen. Die Emittentin ist berechtigt, beim Amtsgericht Frankfurt am Main Kapital- oder Zinsbeträge zu hinterlegen, die von den Gläubigern nicht innerhalb von zwölf Monaten nach dem Fälligkeitstag beansprucht worden sind, auch wenn die Gläubiger sich nicht in Annahmeverzug befinden. Falls und soweit eine solche Hinterlegung erfolgt, und auf das Recht der Rücknahme verzichtet wird, erlöschen die entsprechenden Ansprüche der Gläubiger gegen die Emittentin. \n§ 7 DIE EMISSIONSSTELLE UND DIE ZAHLSTELLEN \n(1) Ernennung; Bezeichnete Geschäftsstellen. Die anfängliche Emissionsstelle und die anfänglichen Zahlstellen und deren bezeichnete Geschäftsstellen lauten wie folgt: \nEmissionsstelle und Hauptzahlstelle: Citibank, N.A. Citigroup Centre Canary Wharf London E14 5LB Vereinigtes Königreich \nZahlstelle: Citigroup Global Markets Deutschland AG Germany Agency & Trust Reuterweg 16 60323 Frankfurt am Main Bundesrepublik Deutschland \nDie Emissionsstelle und die Zahlstellen behalten sich das Recht vor, jederzeit ihre jeweiligen bezeichneten Geschäftsstellen durch andere bezeichnete Geschäftsstellen in derselben Stadt zu ersetzen. \n(2) Änderung der Bestellung oder Abberufung. Die Emittentin behält sich das Recht vor, jederzeit die Bestellung der Emissionsstelle oder einer Zahlstelle zu ändern oder zu beenden und eine andere Emissionsstelle oder zusätzliche oder andere Zahlstellen zu bestellen. Die Emittentin wird jedoch zu jedem Zeitpunkt (i) eine Emissionsstelle unterhalten, (ii) zusätzlich zu der Emissionsstelle eine Zahlstelle mit einer bezeichneten Geschäftsstelle in einer kontinentaleuropäischen Stadt, und (iii) solange die Schuldverschreibungen an der Luxemburger Börse notiert sind, eine Zahlstelle (die die Emissionsstelle sein kann) mit bezeichneter Geschäftsstelle in Luxemburg und/oder an einem anderen von einer anderen Börse hierfür vorgeschriebenen Ort unterhalten. \nJede Änderung, Abberufung, Bestellung oder jeder sonstige Wechsel wird nur wirksam (außer im Insolvenzfall, in dem eine solche Änderung sofort wirksam wird), sofern die Gläubiger hierüber gemäß § 16 vorab unter Einhaltung einer Frist von mindestens 30 und nicht mehr als 45 Tagen informiert wurden. \n(3) Beauftragte der Emittentin. Die Emissionsstelle und die Zahlstellen handeln ausschließlich als Beauftragte der Emittentin und übernehmen keinerlei Verpflichtungen gegenüber den Gläubigern und es wird kein Auftrags- oder Treuhandverhältnis zwischen ihnen und den Gläubigern begründet. \n§ 8 BESTEUERUNG \nSämtliche in Bezug auf die Schuldverschreibungen zu zahlenden Beträge \nsind ohne Einbehalt oder Abzug von oder aufgrund von gegenwärtigen oder zukünftigen Steuern, Abgaben oder amtlichen Gebühren zu leisten, die von oder in den Niederlanden oder der Bundesrepublik Deutschland oder für deren Rechnung oder von oder für Rechnung einer politischen Untergliederung oder Steuerbehörde der oder in den Niederlanden oder der Bundesrepublik Deutschland oder den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika oder einer politisch untergeordneten Einheit (\"Quellensteuern\") auferlegt, erhoben oder eingezogen werden, es sei denn, dieser Einbehalt oder Abzug ist gesetzlich vorgeschrieben. In diesem Fall wird die Emittentin, außer in den nachstehend aufgeführten Ausnahmefällen, diejenigen zusätzlichen Beträge (die \"Zusätzlichen Beträge\") zahlen, die erforderlich sind, damit die den Gläubigern auf die Schuldverschreibungen zufließenden Nettobeträge nach diesem Einbehalt oder Abzug jeweils den Beträgen entsprechen, die ohne einen solchen Einbehalt oder Abzug zahlbar wären. Die Verpflichtung zur Zahlung solcher Zusätzlichen Beträge besteht allerdings nicht im Hinblick auf Steuern, Abgaben oder amtliche Gebühren, die: \n(1) von einer als Depotbank oder Inkassobeauftragter des Gläubigers handelnden Person oder sonst auf andere Weise zu entrichten sind als dadurch, dass die Emittentin aus den von ihr zu leistenden Zahlungen von Kapital oder Zinsen einen Abzug oder Einbehalt vornimmt; oder \n(2) wegen einer Rechtsänderung zu zahlen sind (oder auf Grund einer Änderung der Anwendung oder offiziellen Auslegung eines Gesetzes oder einer Vorschrift), welche später als 30 Tage nach Fälligkeit der betreffenden Zahlung oder, wenn dies später erfolgt, ordnungsgemäßer Bereitstellung aller fälligen Beträge und einer diesbezüglichen Bekanntmachung gemäß § 16 wirksam wird; oder \n(3) von einer Zahlstelle abgezogen oder einbehalten werden, wenn eine andere Zahlstelle die Zahlung ohne einen solchen Einbehalt oder Abzug hätte leisten können; oder \n(4) wegen einer gegenwärtigen oder früheren persönlichen oder geschäftlichen Beziehung des Gläubigers zu den Niederlanden oder der Bundesrepublik Deutschland zu zahlen sind und nicht allein aufgrund der Tatsache, dass Zahlungen in Bezug auf die Schuldverschreibungen oder aus der Garantie (wie in § 10 definiert) aus den Niederlanden oder aus der Bundesrepublik Deutschland stammen oder steuerlich so behandelt werden, oder dort besichert sind; oder \n(5) aufgrund (i) einer Richtlinie oder Verordnung der Europäischen Union betreffend die Besteuerung von Zinserträgen oder (ii) einer zwischenstaatlichen Vereinbarung über deren Besteuerung, an der die Niederlande oder die Bundesrepublik Deutschland oder die Europäische Union beteiligt ist, oder (iii) einer gesetzlichen Vorschrift, die diese Richtlinie, Verordnung oder Vereinbarung umsetzt oder befolgt, abzuziehen oder einzubehalten sind, oder (iv) der Abschnitte 1471 bis 1474 des U.S. Internal Revenue Codes von 1986, in seiner jeweils gültigen Fassung, und gegenwärtigen oder zukünftigen Regelungen oder seiner offiziellen Auslegungen oder Verträgen unter ihm (einschließlich, ohne Beschränkung, einer jeden zwischenstaatlichen Vereinbarung zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und einer anderen Jurisdiktion oder gemäß jeder Vereinbarung, gesetzlichen Regelung, Verordnung oder anderen offiziellen Verlautbarungen, die die Bundesrepublik Deutschland zur Umsetzung solcher zwischenstaatlicher Vereinbarungen befolgt hat) (\"FATCA\"); oder \n(6) nicht zu entrichten wären, wenn die Schuldverschreibungen bei einem Kreditinstitut verwahrt und die Zahlungen von diesem eingezogen worden wären. \n§ 9 KÜNDIGUNGSRECHT \n(1) Kündigungsgründe. Jeder Gläubiger ist berechtigt, seine Schuldverschreibungen zu kündigen und deren sofortige Rückzahlung zum vorzeitigen Rückzahlungsbetrag (wie in § 5 Absatz 2 beschrieben) zuzüglich etwaiger aufgelaufener Zinsen bis zum Tag der Rückzahlung zu verlangen, falls: \n(a) bezüglich der Schuldverschreibungen zahlbare Beträge nicht innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach dem jeweiligen Fälligkeitstag gezahlt wurden; oder \n(b) die Emittentin die Erfüllung irgendeiner anderen Verpflichtung aus den Schuldverschreibungen oder die Garantin die Erfüllung einer Verpflichtung aus der in der Garantie enthaltenen Verpflichtungserklärung (wie in § 10 definiert) unterlässt und die Unterlassung, sofern diese nicht geheilt wurde, länger als 90 Tage fortdauert, nachdem die Emissionsstelle hierüber eine Benachrichtigung von einem Gläubiger erhalten hat; oder \n(c) die Emittentin oder die Garantin ihre Zahlungsunfähigkeit bekannt gibt; oder \n(d) ein Gericht ein Konkurs- oder sonstiges Insolvenzverfahren gegen die Emittentin oder die Garantin eröffnet, ein solches Verfahren eingeleitet und nicht innerhalb von 60 Tagen aufgehoben oder ausgesetzt worden ist, oder die Emittentin oder die Garantin ein solches Verfahren beantragt oder einleitet oder eine allgemeine Schuldenregelung zugunsten ihrer Gläubiger anbietet oder trifft oder die Emittentin ein \"Surseance van Betaling\" (im Sinne der Konkursgesetze der Niederlande (\"Faillissementswet\") beantragt; oder \n(e) die Emittentin oder die Garantin in Liquidation tritt, es sei denn, dies geschieht im Zusammenhang mit einer Verschmelzung, Zusammenlegung oder anderen Form des Zusammenschlusses mit einer anderen Gesellschaft und die andere oder neue Gesellschaft übernimmt alle Verpflichtungen, die die Emittentin bzw. die Garantin im Zusammenhang mit dieser Anleihe eingegangen ist; oder \n(f) die Garantie erlischt. \n(2) Erlöschen. Das Kündigungsrecht erlischt, falls der Kündigungsgrund vor Ausübung des Rechts geheilt wurde. \n(3) Mitteilung. Eine Benachrichtigung einschließlich einer Kündigung hat nach diesem § 9 schriftlich in deutscher oder englischer Sprache durch persönliche Zustellung oder eingeschriebenen Brief an die festgelegte Niederlassung der Emissionsstelle zu erfolgen; darin ist der Kapitalbetrag der betreffenden Schuldverschreibungen anzugeben und ein den Anforderungen der Emissionsstelle genügender Nachweis über das Eigentum an den Schuldverschreibungen beizufügen. \n§ 10 NEGATIVVERPFLICHTUNG DER EMITTENTIN, GARANTIE UND VERPFLICHTUNG DER GARANTIN \n(1) Negativverpflichtung. Die Emittentin verpflichtet sich, solange Schuldverschreibungen ausstehen, jedoch nur bis zu dem Zeitpunkt, an dem alle Beträge an Kapital und Zinsen der Emissionsstelle zur Verfügung gestellt worden sind, für andere Schuldverschreibungen oder Anleihen, einschließlich einer dafür übernommenen Garantie oder Gewährleistung, keine Sicherheiten an ihrem Vermögen zu bestellen, ohne gleichzeitig und im gleichen Rang die Gläubiger dieser Schuldverschreibungen an solchen Sicherheiten teilnehmen \n10 \nzu lassen. Zur Vermeidung etwaiger Zweifel, die Verpflichtung in diesem § 10 gilt nicht in Bezug auf Sicherheiten, die in Zusammenhang mit von Tochtergesellschaften der Volkswagen Financial Services AG begebenen asset-backed-securities (strukturierte Wertpapiere, die mit Vermögenswerten besichert sind) gestellt werden oder für asset-backed-securities, die von einer Zweckgesellschaft begeben werden, und bei denen die Emittentin die ursprüngliche Inhaberin der zugrunde liegenden Vermögenswerte ist. \n(2) Garantie. Volkswagen Financial Services Aktiengesellschaft (die \"Garantin\") hat die unbedingte und unwiderrufliche Garantie (die \"Garantie\") für die ordnungsgemäße Zahlung der Beträge, die Kapital und Zinsen der Schuldverschreibungen entsprechen, übernommen. Darüber hinaus hat sich die Garantin in dieser Garantie verpflichtet (die \"Verpflichtungserklärung\"), solange Schuldverschreibungen ausstehen, jedoch nur bis zum Zeitpunkt, an dem alle Beträge an Kapital und Zinsen der Zahlstelle zur Verfügung gestellt worden sind, für andere Anleiheemissionen, einschließlich dafür übernommener Garantien oder Gewährleistungen, keine Sicherheiten an ihrem Vermögen zu bestellen, ohne gleichzeitig und im gleichen Rang die Gläubiger dieser Schuldverschreibungen an solchen Sicherheiten teilnehmen zu lassen. Zur Vermeidung etwaiger Zweifel, die Verpflichtungserklärung in diesem § 10 gilt nicht in Bezug auf Sicherheiten, die in Zusammenhang mit von einer Tochtergesellschaft der Garantin begebenen asset-backed-securities (strukturierte Wertpapiere, die mit Vermögenswerten besichert sind) gestellt werden oder für asset-backed-securities, die von einer Zweckgesellschaft begeben werden, und bei denen eine Tochtergesellschaft der Garantin die ursprüngliche Inhaberin der zugrunde liegenden Vermögenswerte ist. \n\"Anleiheemission\" ist eine Emission von Schuldverschreibungen, die an einer Wertpapierbörse, im Freiverkehr oder an einem anderen Wertpapiermarkt notiert, eingeführt oder gehandelt werden bzw. notiert, eingeführt oder gehandelt werden sollen oder können. \n(3) Treuhänderin. Die Rechte aus der Garantie, der Verpflichtungserklärung sowie aus jeder etwa aufgrund dieses § 10 gewährten Sicherheit werden, soweit rechtlich möglich, ausschließlich von der Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft als Treuhänderin (die \"Treuhänderin\") für die Gläubiger oder einem von der Treuhänderin zum Handeln für sie oder an ihrer Stelle beauftragten Dritten gehalten und wahrgenommen. \n§ 11 TREUHANDSCHAFT \n(1) Treuhandvertrag. Die Rechte und Pflichten der Treuhänderin richten sich nach einem zwischen ihr, Volkswagen Financial Services Aktiengesellschaft, Volkswagen Leasing GmbH, Volkswagen Financial Services N.V., Volkswagen Financial Services Japan Ltd. und Volkswagen Financial Services Australia Pty Limited abgeschlossenen Treuhandvertrag, der bei der Hauptniederlassung der Treuhänderin in Frankfurt am Main eingesehen werden kann. Dieser sieht u.a. folgendes vor: \n(a) Die Treuhänderin ist zu einem Tätigwerden nur verpflichtet, wenn und soweit sie (i) einen angemessenen, sie zufriedenstellenden Kostenvorschuss für eigene Auslagen und Kosten der Beauftragung Dritter, einschließlich der Kosten der Einschaltung von Rechtsberatern oder anderen Sachverständigen, erhalten hat oder (ii) von der Emittentin oder der Garantin über die beabsichtigte Bestellung einer Sicherheit für die Anleihe benachrichtigt wird. \n(b) Die Treuhänderin ist berechtigt, Kosten, die ihr oder dem von ihr beauftragten Dritten bei der Wahrnehmung der für Rechnung der Gläubiger gehaltenen Rechte etwa entstanden sind, den \n11 \nGläubigern im Verhältnis ihrer Forderungen auf die Schuldverschreibungen in Rechnung zu stellen. \n(c) Die Treuhänderin haftet daraus, dass sie im Zusammenhang mit den Schuldverschreibungen Erklärungen abgibt, nicht abgibt oder entgegennimmt und Maßnahmen trifft oder unterlässt, nur, wenn und soweit sie die Sorgfalt eines ordentlichen Kaufmanns verletzt hat. Von den Beschränkungen des § 181 BGB oder einer entsprechenden Beschränkung aufgrund der gesetzlichen Vorschriften eines anderen Landes ist sie befreit. \n(d) Die Treuhänderin ist jederzeit und ohne Angabe von Gründen berechtigt, von ihrer Verpflichtung als Treuhänderin zurückzutreten, indem sie dies unter Einhaltung einer Frist von mindestens drei Monaten der Emittentin und der Garantin mitteilt, und eine andere allgemein anerkannte Bank oder Treuhandgesellschaft zu ihrem Nachfolger zu bestellen. Sollte die Treuhänderin zu der Bestellung außerstande sein, so wird die Emittentin diese vornehmen. Eine solche Nachfolgerbestellung ist unverzüglich gemäß § 16 bekanntzumachen. \n(e) Änderungen des Treuhandvertrages können ohne Zustimmung der Gläubiger erfolgen, sofern sie deren Interessen nicht wesentlich beeinträchtigen. \n(2) Fällig und zahlbar erklärte Schuldverschreibungen. Wenn die Treuhänderin oder gegebenenfalls der von ihr beauftragte Dritte nach Eintritt eines der in § 9 aufgeführten Kündigungsgründe wegen des Kapitals von nicht schon aus anderen Gründen fälligen Schuldverschreibungen die Garantie oder eine für die Schuldverschreibungen erteilte Sicherheit in Anspruch nimmt, gelten die betreffenden Schuldverschreibungen in jeder Beziehung als zur Rückzahlung zum vorzeitigen Rückzahlungsbetrag (wie in § 5 Absatz 2 definiert) zahlbar und fällig. \n§ 12 ERSETZUNG DER EMITTENTIN \n(1) Ersetzung. Die Emittentin ist jederzeit berechtigt, ohne Zustimmung der Gläubiger, entweder die Garantin oder eine andere Gesellschaft, deren stimmberechtigte Aktien oder andere Anteilsrechte direkt oder indirekt zu mehr als 90% von der Garantin gehalten werden, als Hauptschuldnerin für alle Verpflichtungen aus oder im Zusammenhang mit den Schuldverschreibungen an ihre Stelle zu setzen (die \"Nachfolgeschuldnerin\"), sofern die Nachfolgeschuldnerin in der Lage ist, alle Zahlungsverpflichtungen aus oder im Zusammenhang mit den Schuldverschreibungen ohne die Notwendigkeit einer Einbehaltung von irgendwelchen Steuern oder Abgaben an der Quelle zu erfüllen sowie die hierzu erforderlichen Beträge ohne Beschränkungen an die Emissionsstelle zu transferieren. Eine solche Ersetzung ist gemäß § 16 zu veröffentlichen. \nDie Emittentin garantiert unwiderruflich und unbedingt gegenüber den Gläubigern die Zahlung aller von der Nachfolgeschuldnerin auf die Schuldverschreibungen zahlbaren Beträge zu Bedingungen, die den Bedingungen des Musters der nicht nachrangigen Garantie der Emittentin hinsichtlich der nicht nachrangigen Schuldverschreibungen, das im Agency Agreement enthalten ist, entsprechen. \n(2) Bezugnahmen auf die Emittentin. Im Falle einer solchen Ersetzung gilt jede Nennung der Emittentin in diesen Anleihebedingungen als auf die Nachfolgeschuldnerin bezogen und jede Nennung des Landes, in dem die Emittentin ihren Sitz hat, als auf das Land bezogen, in dem die Nachfolgeschuldnerin ihren Sitz hat. \n(3) Negativerklärung. Sofern die Garantin die Nachfolgeschuldnerin wird, \n12 \nfindet § 10 Absatz 2 keine Anwendung mehr, die Verpflichtungserklärung der Garantin bleibt jedoch für diese bindend. \n§ 13 BESCHLÜSSE DER GLÄUBIGER; GEMEINSAMER VERTRETER \n(1) Änderungen der Anleihebedingungen durch Beschluss der Gläubiger. Diese Anleihebedingungen können durch die Emittentin mit Zustimmung der Gläubiger aufgrund Mehrheitsbeschlusses nach Maßgabe der §§ 5 ff. des Gesetzes über Schuldverschreibungen aus Gesamtemissionen (Schuldverschreibungsgesetz - \"SchVG\") in seiner jeweiligen gültigen Fassung geändert werden. Die Gläubiger können insbesondere einer Änderung wesentlicher Inhalte der Anleihebedingungen zustimmen, einschließlich der in § 5 Absatz 3 SchVG vorgesehenen Maßnahmen. Ein ordnungsgemäß gefasster Mehrheitsbeschluss ist für alle Gläubiger verbindlich. \n(2) Mehrheitserfordernisse. Vorbehaltlich der Erreichung der erforderlichen Beschlussfähigkeit, entscheiden die Gläubiger mit den in § 5 Absatz 4 Satz 1 und Satz 2 SchVG genannten Mehrheiten. \n(3) Verfahren. Beschlüsse der Gläubiger werden im Wege der Abstimmung ohne Versammlung nach § 18 SchVG getroffen. Gläubiger, deren Schuldverschreibungen zusammen 5 % des jeweils ausstehenden Gesamtnennbetrags der Schuldverschreibungen erreichen, können schriftlich die Durchführung einer Abstimmung ohne Versammlung nach Maßgabe von § 9 i.V.m. § 18 SchVG verlangen. Die Aufforderung zur Stimmabgabe durch den Abstimmungsleiter regelt die weiteren Einzelheiten der Beschlussfassung und der Abstimmung. Mit der Aufforderung zur Stimmabgabe werden die Beschlussgegenstände sowie die Vorschläge zur Beschlussfassung den Gläubigern bekannt gegeben. \n(4) Teilnahmeberechtigung. Gläubiger haben die Berechtigung zur Teilnahme an der Abstimmung zum Zeitpunkt der Stimmabgabe durch besonderen Nachweis ihrer Depotbank, welche (a) den vollständigen Namen und die vollständige Adresse des Gläubigers enthält, (b) den Gesamtnennbetrag der Schuldverschreibungen bezeichnet, die unter dem Datum der Bestätigung auf dem Wertpapierdepot verbucht sind, und (c) bestätigt, dass die Depotbank (wie in § 17(5) definiert) gegenüber dem Clearing System eine schriftliche Erklärung abgegeben hat, die die vorstehend unter (a) und (b) bezeichneten Informationen enthält, und die Vorlage eines Sperrvermerks ihrer Depotbank zugunsten der Zahlstelle als Hinterlegungsstelle für den Abstimmungszeitraum nachzuweisen.", "label": [[603, 637, "DefineIssuerName"], [749, 794, "DefineInstrumentMaturityDate"], [639, 749, "DefineInstrumentMaturityDate"], [6864, 7231, "DefineDenomination"]]}

Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg, having a share capital of EUR 31,000, and duly registered with the Registre de Commerce et des \nSociétés, Luxembourg with number B206430) (“SPIRE”) \nacting in respect of its Compartment 2020-170 \nIssue of Series 2020-170 NOK 250,000,000 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2027 \nunder the Secured Note Programme \nThis document is a series memorandum (the “Series Memorandum”), which contains information relating to \nthe above notes (the “Notes”) issued by SPIRE acting in respect of its Compartment 2020-170 (the “Issuer”). \nThis Series Memorandum should be read in conjunction with all documents which are incorporated by reference \nin the “Documents Incorporated by Reference” section herein, including the relevant sections of the base \nprospectus dated 3 April 2020 (the “Base Prospectus”) relating to the Secured Note Programme (the \n“Programme”) of SPIRE. Unless defined herein, terms defined in the Base Prospectus have the same \nmeanings in this Series Memorandum. \nThis Series Memorandum is not an advertisement and neither this Series Memorandum nor the Pricing \nTerms contained in this Series Memorandum constitutes a prospectus or final terms for the purposes \nof Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). \nThe Issuer is not offering the Notes in any jurisdiction in circumstances which would require a \nprospectus pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation. Nor is any person authorised to make such an offer \nof the Notes on behalf of the Issuer in any jurisdiction. \nApplication has been made to The Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Dublin”), \nfor the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin (the “Official List”) and to trading on its Global \nExchange Market (“GEM”). This document constitutes listing particulars for the purpose of such application and \nhas been approved by Euronext Dublin. The GEM is not a regulated market for the purposes of Directive \n2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments (as amended, \n“MiFID II”). \nReferences in this Series Memorandum to Notes being “listed” (and all related references) shall mean that such \nNotes have been admitted to trading on the GEM and have been admitted to the Official List. \nThe Notes are not rated. \nProspective investors should have regard to the risk factors described and referred to under the section \nof this Series Memorandum titled “Risk Factors” and, in particular, to the limited recourse nature of the \nNotes and the fact that the Issuer is a special purpose vehicle. \nDealer \nJ.P. Morgan \nThe date of this Series Memorandum is 3 June 2020 \nThe Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Series Memorandum. To the best of the \nIssuer’s knowledge (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information contained \nin this Series Memorandum is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import \nof such information. \nSolely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect \nof the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and \nprofessional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible \ncounterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or \nrecommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market \nassessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market \nassessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) \nand determining appropriate distribution channels. \nThe Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or \notherwise made available to any retail investor (and, for the avoidance of doubt, this means any retail investor \nwithin or outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United Kingdom (the “UK”)). For these purposes, \na retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “Retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) \nof MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended), where that customer would \nnot qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor \nas defined in the Prospectus Regulation. \nNo key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) \nfor offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has \nbeen prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor \nin the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. \nThe information contained in this Series Memorandum is supplemental to, and should be read in conjunction with, \nthe Base Prospectus (see the section titled “Documents Incorporated by Reference” below). This Series \nMemorandum includes particulars for the purpose of giving information with regard to the issue by the Issuer of \nthe Notes. \nNo person has been authorised to give any information or to make any representation other than those contained \nin this Series Memorandum in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes and, if given or made, such \ninformation or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorised by the Issuer or the Dealer (as \nspecified in the Pricing Terms contained in this Series Memorandum). Neither the delivery of this Series \nMemorandum nor any sale of Notes made in connection therewith shall, under any circumstances, create any \nimplication that there has been no change in the affairs of the Issuer since the date of this Series Memorandum \nor the date upon which this Series Memorandum has been most recently amended or supplemented or that there \nhas been no adverse change in the financial position of the Issuer since the date of this Series Memorandum or \nthe date upon which this Series Memorandum has been most recently amended or supplemented or that any \nother information supplied in connection with the Programme or the Notes is correct as of any time subsequent \nto the date on which it is supplied or, if different, the date indicated in the document containing the same. \nThe language of this Series Memorandum is English.

The Dealer makes no representation, express or implied, or, to the fullest extent permitted by law, \naccepts no responsibility, with respect to (i) the Notes, (ii) the Transaction Documents (including the effectiveness \nthereof) or (iii) the accuracy or completeness of any of the information in this Series Memorandum or for any other \nstatement made or purported to be made by the Dealer or on its behalf in connection with the Issuer or the issue \nand offering of the Notes. The Dealer accordingly disclaims all and any liability whether arising in tort or contract \nor otherwise (save as referred to above) which it might otherwise have in respect of the Notes, the Transaction \nDocuments or this Series Memorandum or any such statement. \nProspective investors should have regard to the factors described under the section headed “Risk Factors” in this \nSeries Memorandum. This Series Memorandum does not describe all of the risks of an investment in the Notes. \nNeither this Series Memorandum nor any financial statements are intended to provide the basis of any credit or \nother evaluation and should not be considered as a recommendation by any of the Issuer or the Dealer that any \nrecipient of this Series Memorandum or any other financial statements should purchase the Notes. \nProspective investors should read the section titled “Disclaimers” set out in pages 5 to 8 of the Base Prospectus \nand ensure that they understand the relevant disclaimers and other information set out therein (which are \nincorporated by reference into, and form a part of, this Series Memorandum). \nTHE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR WITH \nANY SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED \nii \nSTATES.

{"id": 27292, "data": "- 1 - PRICING SUPPLEMENT \nPROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS: The Securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (\"MiFID II\"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (\"IMD\"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the \"Prospectus Directive\"). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the \"PRIIPs Regulation\") for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. Notwithstanding the above, if the Issuer subsequently prepares and publishes a key information document under the PRIIPs Regulation in respect of the Securities, then the prohibition on the offering, sale or otherwise making available the Securities to a retail investor as described above shall no longer apply. \nMiFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Securities (a \"distributor\") should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer‘s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. \nPricing Supplement dated 20 November 2018 \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. \nStructured Products Programme for the issuance of Notes, Warrants and Certificates \n(the \"Programme\") \nSEK 120,000,000 10-Year Fixed Coupon Notes, due November 2028 (the \"Securities\" or the \"Notes\") \nThe offering circular dated 25 April 2018 and the Supplement(s) to the offering circular listed in the Annex hereto (as so supplemented, the \"Offering Circular\") (as completed and (if applicable) amended by this Pricing Supplement) has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Securities in any Member State of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a \"Relevant Member State\") will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive, as implemented in that Relevant Member State, from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Securities. The expression \"Prospectus Directive\" means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including by Directive 2010/73/EU), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that Relevant Member State of the Securities may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any Dealer to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor any Dealer has authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of the Securities in any other circumstances. - 2 - The Securities will not be offered, sold or otherwise distributed in or from Switzerland and neither this Pricing Supplement nor any other document relating to the Securities may be distributed in or from Switzerland in connection with any such offering or distribution, except to individually selected qualified investors within the meaning of, and in accordance with, the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes. \nIf you purchase the Securities described in this Pricing Supplement after the date hereof, you should review the most recent restatement (if any) of the Offering Circular and each supplement thereafter up to (and including) the date of purchase to ensure that you have the most up to date information on the Issuer and (if applicable) the Guarantor on which to base your investment decision (note that the terms and conditions of the Securities will remain as described in this Pricing Supplement and the version of the Offering Circular described above, subject to any amendments notified to the Holder). Each supplement and restatement (if any) to the Offering Circular can be found on (www.bourse.lu) and (www.ise.ie). \nRISK FACTORS \nPurchase of the Securities involves substantial risks \nInvestors should ensure that they understand the nature of the risks posed by, and the extent of their exposure under, the Securities. Investors should make all pertinent inquiries they deem necessary without relying on the Issuer or the Dealer. Investors should consider the suitability of the Securities as an investment in light of their own circumstances, investment objectives, tax position and financial condition. Investors should consider carefully all the information set forth in this Pricing Supplement along with all the information set forth in the Offering Circular. Investors should pay particular attention to the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in the Offering Circular (pages 30 to 110 inclusive). \nUnregulated Securities: The Securities does not constitute a participation in a collective investment scheme within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes and are not subject to supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA \nThe Securities do not constitute a participation in a collective investment scheme within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes and the Securities is not subject to approval, registration or supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA or any other regulatory authority in Switzerland. Accordingly, investors do not have the benefit of the specific investor protection provided under the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes and are exposed to the credit risk of the Issuer. \nU.S. insolvency and resolution considerations \nNew York Law Notes constitute \"loss-absorbing capacity\" within the meaning of the final rules (the \"TLAC rules\") issued by the Federal Reserve on 15 December 2016 regarding, among other things, the minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity that certain U.S. bank holding companies, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., will be required to maintain, commencing 1 January 2019. Such debt must satisfy certain eligibility criteria under the TLAC rules. If JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to enter into resolution, either in a proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or into a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, holders of New York Law Notes and other debt and equity securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (including other Securities issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co.) will absorb the losses of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates. \nUnder Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a detailed plan (the \"resolution plan\") for the rapid and orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its material subsidiaries under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of material financial distress or failure. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s preferred resolution strategy under its resolution plan contemplates that only JPMorgan Chase & Co. would enter bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code pursuant to a \"single point of entry\" recapitalisation strategy. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s subsidiaries would be recapitalised as - 3 - needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s equity securities and thereafter on unsecured creditors, including holders of New York Law Notes and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (including other Securities issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co.). Claims of holders of New York Law Notes and such other debt securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Accordingly, in a resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, holders of New York Law Notes and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (including other Securities issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co.) would realise value only to the extent available to JPMorgan Chase & Co. as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been fully repaid. If JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to enter into resolution, none of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s preferred resolution strategy under its resolution plan. \nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalisation model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. Pursuant to that strategy, the FDIC would use its power to create a \"bridge entity\" for JPMorgan Chase & Co.; transfer the systemically important and viable parts of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity; recapitalise those subsidiaries using assets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. that have been transferred to the bridge entity; and exchange external debt claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co. for equity in the bridge entity. Under this Title II resolution strategy, the value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of New York Law Notes and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (including other Securities issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co.) may not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such New York Law Notes and other securities. To date, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy, and it is not obligated to follow such a strategy in a Title II resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. \nPART A – CONTRACTUAL TERMS \nTerms used herein shall be deemed to be defined as such for the purposes of the General Conditions and the Specific Product Provisions (as may be amended and/or supplemented up to, and including, the Issue Date) set forth in the Offering Circular.

Its LEI is 549300EVRWDWFJUNNP53. \nIssuer's principal activities: The Issuer grants loans and other forms of funding to Citigroup Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\"), and therefore may compete in any market in which the Group has a presence, and may finance itself in whatever form, including through issuance of the Notes, and carry on incidental activities. \nMajor shareholders, including whether it is directly or indirectly owned or controlled and by whom: The shares of the Issuer are held by Citigroup Global Markets Funding Luxembourg GP S.à r.l. and Citigroup Global Markets Limited (\"CGML\" or the \"Guarantor\"). All of the issued share capital of CGML is owned by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Bahamas Limited, which is an indirect subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. \nKey managing directors: The Issuer is managed by Citigroup Global Markets Funding Luxembourg GP S.à r.l. in its capacity as manager (the \"Corporate Manager\"). The members of the board of managers of the Corporate Manager are Ms. Alberta Brusi, Mr. Vincent Mazzoli and Mr. Jonas Bossau. \nStatutory auditors: The Issuer's approved statutory auditor (réviseur d'enterprises agréé) is KPMG Luxembourg Société Coopérative of 39, avenue J.F. Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg. \nWhat is the key financial information regarding the Issuer? \nThe following key financial information has been extracted from the audited non-consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018. \nSummary information – income statement \nYear ended 31 Year ended 31 December 2019 December 2018 (audited) (audited) \nProfit before income tax (in thousands of U.S. dollars) 121 50 \nCGMFL25702 \nSummary information – balance sheet \nYear ended 31 Year ended 31 December 2019 December 2018 (audited) (audited) \nNet financial debt (long term debt plus short term debt 12,746,867 minus cash) (in thousands of U.S. dollars) 7,753,224 \nCurrent ratio (current assets/current liabilities) 100% 100% \nDebt to equity ratio (total liabilities/total shareholder equity) 1395849% 934648% \nInterest cover ratio (operating income/interest expense)* Not Applicable Not Applicable \nSummary information – cash flow statement \nYear ended 31 Year ended 31 December 2019 December 2018 (audited) (audited) \nNet cash flows from operating activities (in thousands 9,381 of U.S. dollars) -290 \nNet cash flows from financing activities (in thousands 3,518,483 of U.S. dollars) 4,304,592 \nNet cash flows from investing activities (in thousands -3,518,474 of U.S. dollars) -4,304,587 \n*In accordance with IFRS, the Issuer does not present any interest expenses. \nQualifications in audit report on historical financial information: \nThere are no qualifications in the audit report of the Issuer on its audited historical financial information. \nWhat are the key risks that are specific to the Issuer? \nThe Issuer is subject to the following key risks: \n• The Issuer is exposed to concentrations of risk, particularly credit and market risk. As regulatory or market developments continue to lead to increased centralisation of trading activities, the Issuer could experience an increase in concentration of risk, which could limit the effectiveness of any hedging strategies and cause the Issuer to incur significant losses. The Issuer may also be affected by macroeconomic, geopolitical and other challenges, uncertainties and volatilities, which may negatively impact the businesses of the Issuer and its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes, and the value of and return on the Notes. \n• The ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under the Notes will be dependent on the Group entities to which it on-lends the funds raised through the issue of the Notes performing their obligations in respect of such funding in a timely manner. Any failure by any such Group entity to do so may negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under the Notes, and the value of and return on the Notes. \n• The Issuer is subject to intra-group credit risk. From time to time, the Issuer enters into derivative transactions with CGML to offset or hedge its liabilities to Noteholders under Notes issued by it (which may include the Notes). As such, the Issuer is exposed to the credit risk of CGML in the form of counterparty risk in respect of such derivative transactions. In particular, the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes is primarily dependent on CGML performing its counterparty obligations owed to the Issuer in respect of such derivative transactions in a timely manner, and any failure by CGML to do so will negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under the Notes. Noteholders will not have any recourse to CGML under any such derivative transactions. \n• The Issuer may not be able to maintain its current ratings. If a rating agency reduces, suspends or withdraws its rating of the Issuer and/or any affiliate thereof, the liquidity and market value of the Notes are likely to be adversely affected. Ratings downgrades could also have a negative impact on other funding sources, such as secured financing and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers. \n• The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, negative impacts on the Group's businesses, revenues, expenses, credit costs and overall results of operations and financial condition which could be material. Any such negative impact on the Group (including the Issuer), could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to \nCGMFL25702 \nfulfil its obligations under the Notes, and consequently the value of and return on the Notes may also be adversely affected. \nKEY INFORMATION ON THE SECURITIES \nWhat are the main features of the Notes? \nType and class of Notes, including security identification numbers: The Securities are debt securities in the form of notes. The Notes will be cleared and settled through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and/or Clearstream Banking, société \nanonyme. \nSeries Number: CGMFL25702; ISIN: XS2304933836; Common Code: 230493383; CFI:DTFNFR; \nFISN: CITIGROUP GLOBA/2.4875EMTN 20330304; CUSIP: 5C01K09O4; WKN:.Not Applicable \nThe issue date of the Notes is 4 March 2021.

CGML operates under the laws of England and Wales and is domiciled in England. Its registered office is at Citigroup Centre, Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LB and its telephone number is +44 (0)207 986 4000. The registration number of CGML is 01763297 on the register maintained by Companies House. Its LEI is XKZZ2JZF41MRHTR1V493. CGML is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. and has a major international presence as a dealer, market maker and underwriter, as well as providing advisory services to a wide range of corporate, institutional and government clients. \nNature and scope of guarantee: The Notes issued will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by CGML pursuant to a deed of guarantee, which constitutes direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of CGML and ranks and will rank pari passu (subject to mandatorily preferred debts under applicable laws) with all other outstanding, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of CGML. \nKey financial information of the Guarantor: The following key financial information has been extracted from the audited non-consolidated financial statements of the Guarantor for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017, and from the unaudited non-consolidated interim financial statements of the Guarantor for the six month period ended 30 June 2019.* \nSummary information – income statement \nYear ended 31 Year ended 31 Six months Six months December 2018 December 2017 ended 30 June ended 30 June (audited) (audited) 2019 2018 (unaudited) (unaudited) \nProfit after taxation (in millions 488 of U.S. dollars) 384 294 214 \nSummary information – balance sheet \nYear ended 31 December 2018 (audited) Year ended 31 December 2017 (audited) Six months ended 30 June 2019 (unaudited) \nNet financial debt (long term 9,697 debt plus short term debt minus cash) (in millions of U.S. dollars) 17,520 16,076 \nDebt to equity ratio (total liabilities/total shareholder equity) 21 23 24 \n*The Guarantor was exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement under IAS 7 for the financial years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017. \nQualifications in audit report on historical financial information: There are no qualifications in the audit report of the Guarantor on its audited historical financial information. \nKey risks in respect of the Guarantor: The Guarantor is subject to the following key risks: \n• The Guarantor is exposed to concentrations of risk, particularly credit and market risk. As regulatory or market developments continue to lead to increased centralisation of trading activities, the Guarantor could experience an \nCGMFL25702 \nincrease in concentration of risk, which could limit the effectiveness of any hedging strategies and cause the Guarantor to incur significant losses. The Guarantor may also be affected by macroeconomic, geopolitical and other challenges, uncertainties and volatilities, which may negatively impact the businesses of the Guarantor and its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes, and the value of and return on the Notes. \n• The Guarantor may not be able to maintain its current ratings. If a rating agency reduces, suspends or withdraws its rating of the Guarantor and/or any affiliate thereof, the liquidity and market value of the Notes are likely to be adversely affected. Ratings downgrades could also have a negative impact on other funding sources, such as secured financing and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers. \n• The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, negative impacts on the Group's businesses, revenues, expenses, credit costs and overall results of operations and financial condition which could be material. Any such negative impact on the Group (including the Guarantor), could adversely affect the ability of the Guarantor to fulfil its obligations under the Notes, and consequently the value of and return on the Notes may also be adversely affected. \nWhat are the key risks that are specific to the Notes? \nThe Notes are subject to the following key risks: \n• Investment in the Notes involves the risk that if market interest rates subsequently increase above the rate paid on the Notes, this will adversely affect the value of the Notes. \n• Credit Risk: The Issuer's obligations under the Notes and the Guarantor's obligations under the deed of guarantee represent general contractual obligations of each respective entity and of no other person. Accordingly, payments under the Notes are subject to the credit risk of the Issuer and the Guarantor. Noteholders will not have recourse to any secured assets of the Issuer or Guarantor in the event that the Issuer or Guarantor is unable to meet its obligations under the Notes, including in the event of an insolvency, and therefore risk losing some or all of their investment. \n• Market Risk: Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop, so investors should be prepared to hold the Notes until maturity. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid. Consequently, you may not be able to sell your Notes easily or at all or at prices equal to or higher than your initial investment and in fact any such price may be substantially less than the original purchase price. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of Notes. \n• Early redemption: In certain circumstances (for example, following an event of default or for reasons relating to taxation or illegality), the Notes may be early redeemed. If the Notes are redeemed early, the amount paid may be less than your initial investment and you may therefore sustain a loss. \nKEY INFORMATION ON THE OFFER OF NOTES TO THE PUBLIC AND/OR THE ADMISSION TO TRADING ON A REGULATED MARKET \nUnder which conditions and timetable can I invest in the Notes? \nTerms and conditions of the offer: \nThe Notes are not being publicly offered. \nEstimated expenses or taxes charged to the investor by issuer/offeror: No expenses are being charged to an investor by the Issuer. \nWho is the offeror and/or the person asking for admission to trading? \nThe Issuer is the entity requesting for the admission to trading of the Notes. \nWhy is the Prospectus being produced? \nUse and estimated net amount of proceeds: \nThe net proceeds of the issue of the Notes will be used primarily to grant loans or other forms of funding to CGML and any entity belonging to the same Group, and may be used to finance the Issuer itself. \nThe estimated net amount of proceeds is 100.00 per cent. of the final aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued on the issue date. \nCGMFL25702 \nUnderwriting agreement on a firm commitment basis: The offer of the Notes is not subject to an underwriting agreement on a firm commitment basis. \nDescription of any interest material to the issue/offer, including conflicting interests: The terms of the Notes confer on the Issuer, the calculation agent and certain other persons discretion in making judgements, determinations and calculations in relation to the Notes.

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the \"PRIIPs Regulation\") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. \nIMPORTANT NOTICE \nIn accessing the attached final terms (the \"Final Terms\") you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. \nThe information contained in the Final Terms may be addressed to and/or targeted at persons who are residents of particular countries only as specified in the Final Terms and/or in the Base Prospectus (as defined in the Final Terms) and is not intended for use and should not be relied upon by any person outside those countries and/or to whom the offer contained in the Final Terms is not addressed.

RATINGS \nThe issuance of Notes itself is expected to be rated: \nS&P Global Ratings Europe Limited A (\"S&P\"): \nMoody's Investors Service Limited Baa1 (\"Moody's\"): \nFitch Ratings Limited (\"Fitch\"): AA- \nIn accordance with S&P's ratings definitions available as at the date of these Final Terms on https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/sourceId/504352, obligations rated 'A' are judged to be more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories and indicate that the relevant issuer's capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation is still strong. In accordance with Moody's ratings definitions available as at the date of these Final Terms on https://www.moodys.com/ratings-process/Ratings-Definitions/002002, obligations rated 'Baa1' are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. In accordance with Fitch's ratings definitions available as at the date of these Final Terms on https://www.fitchratings.com/site/definitions, a rating of 'AA-' indicates expectations of very low default risk and that the relevant issuer has a very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments, which is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events. \n3.

This Pricing \nSupplement must be read in conjunction with the Offering Circular dated 25 June 2021 (the \"Offering Circular\"). Full information on the Issuer and the offer of the Notes is only available on the basis of the combination of this \nPricing Supplement and the Offering Circular. Copies of the Offering Circular are available from the offices of Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc at 25 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London, E14 4QA. The Offering Circular has also been published on the website of the Euronext Dublin (www.live.euronext.com), the \nLuxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) \nInformation Concerning Investment Risk \nNoteholders and prospective purchasers of Notes should ensure that they understand the nature of the \nNotes and the extent of their exposure to risk and that they consider the suitability of the Notes as an \ninvestment in the light of their own circumstances and financial condition. The amount payable on \nredemption of the Notes is linked to the performance of the Underlying (as defined herein), and may be less \nthan par. Given the highly specialised nature of these Notes, Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (“the \nIssuer”)(\"MSI plc\") consider that they are only suitable for highly sophisticated investors who are able to \ndetermine for themselves the risk of an investment linked to the Underlying, are willing to take risks and \ncan absorb the partial loss of their initial investment. Consequently, if you are not an investor who falls \nwithin the description above you should not consider purchasing these Notes without taking detailed advice \nfrom a specialised professional adviser. \nPotential investors are urged to consult with their legal, regulatory, investment, accounting, tax and other \nadvisors with regard to any proposed or actual investment in these Notes. Please see the Offering Circular \ntogether with the Pricing Supplement for a full detailed description of the Notes and in particular, please \nreview the Risk Factors associated with these Notes. Investing in the Notes entails certain risks including, \nbut not limited to, the following: \nSeries: 16701 2 \nCapital is not protected: the final redemption amount depends on the performance of the Underlying and \ncould be zero. \nAdjustments by the Determination Agent: The terms and conditions of the Notes will allow the \nDetermination Agent to make adjustments or take any other appropriate action if circumstances occur \nwhere the Notes or any exchanges are affected by market disruption, adjustment events or circumstances \naffecting normal activities. These circumstances include the Nationalisation, Delisting, Insolvency or a \nTakeover or Merger of the share issuers of the Underlying(s) as applicable. \nIn addition, other circumstances may occur which either increase the liability of the Issuer fulfilling its \nobligations under the Notes or increase the liability of any hedging activities related to such obligations, \nincluding without limitation the adoption of or any change in any tax law relating to a common system of \nfinancial transaction tax in the European Union or otherwise. \nIn such circumstances, the Determination Agent can in its sole and absolute discretion determine whether \nto redeem the Notes early, or adjust the terms of the Notes, which may include without limitation \nadjustments to the Initial Reference Price, the Final Redemption Amount or the Underlying. The \nDetermination Agent also has the discretion to make adjustments with respect to any corporate action. \nPotential investors should see the Offering Circular for a detailed description of potential adjustment events \nand adjustments. \nBasket Components Risk: The Notes will be redeemed at an amount determined by reference to the \nperformance of the Basket Components and such performance will therefore affect the nature and value \nof the investment return on the Notes. Noteholders and prospective purchasers of Notes should conduct \ntheir own investigations and, in deciding whether or not to purchase Notes, prospective purchasers should \nform their own views of the merits of an investment related to the Basket Components based upon such \ninvestigations and not in reliance on any information given in this document. \nExit Risk: Any secondary market price of the Notes will depend on many factors, including the value and \nvolatility of the Underlying(s), interest rates, the dividend rate on the stocks that compose the Underlying \n(if any), time remaining to maturity and the creditworthiness of the Issuer. The secondary market price \nmay be lower than the market value of the issued Notes as at the Issue Date to take into account amounts \npaid to distributors and other intermediaries relating to the issue and sale of the Notes as well as amounts \nrelating to the hedging of the Issuer's obligations. As a result of all of these factors, the holder may receive \nan amount in the secondary market which may be less than the then intrinsic market value of the Note and \nwhich may also be less than the amount the holder would have received had the holder held the Security \nthrough to maturity. \nCredit Risk: Investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Issuer. The Notes are essentially a loan to the \nIssuer with a repayment amount linked to the performance of the Underlying that the Issuer promises to \npay at maturity. There is the risk, however, that the Issuer may not be able to fulfill its obligations, \nirrespective of whether the Notes are referred to as capital or principal protected. Investors may lose all or \npart of their investment if the Issuer is unable to pay the coupons (if any) or the redemption amount. No \nassets of the Issuer are segregated and specifically set aside in order to pay the holders of the Notes in the \nevent of liquidation of the Issuer, and the holders of the Notes will rank behind secured or preferred \ncreditors. \nLiquidity Risk: Any secondary market in the Notes made by the Dealer or its affiliates will be made on a \nreasonable efforts basis only and subject to market conditions, law, regulation and internal policy. Even \nwhilst there may be a secondary market in the Notes it may not be liquid enough to facilitate a sale by the \nholder. \nProduct Market Risk: The value of the Notes and the returns available under the terms of the Notes will \nbe influenced and dependent on the value of the Underlying. It is impossible to predict how the level of the \nSeries: 16701 3 \nUnderlying will vary over time. The historical performance (if any) of the Underlying is not indicative of \nits future performance. \nHedging Risk: On or prior to and after the Trade Date, the Issuer, through its affiliates or others, will likely \nhedge its anticipated exposure under the Notes by taking positions in the Underlying(s), in option contracts \non the Underlying(s) or positions in any other available securities or instruments. In addition, the Issuer \nand its affiliates trade the Underlying(s) as part of their general businesses. Any of these activities could \npotentially affect the value of the Underlying(s), and accordingly, could affect the pay-out to holders on the \nNotes. \nNo Shareholder Rights: A holder of Notes will have no beneficial interest in the stocks that compose the \nrelevant Underlying nor any voting rights and will not have the right to receive dividends or other \ndistributions with respect to the stocks that compose the Underlying. \nUnderlying Issuer Risk: The issuer of the relevant Underlying is not an affiliate of the Issuer or its affiliates \nand is not involved with this offering in any way. Consequently, the Issuer and the Determination Agent \nhave no ability to control the actions of the issuer of the relevant Underlying, including and rebalancing \nthat could trigger an adjustment to the terms of the Notes by the Determination Agent. \nPotential Conflict of Interest: The Determination Agent, which is also the Issuer, will determine the payout \nto the investor at maturity. Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and its affiliates may trade the \nUnderlying on a regular basis as part of its general broker-dealer business and may also carry out hedging \nactivities in relation to the Notes. Any of these activities could influence the Determination Agent’s \ndetermination of adjustments made to any Notes and any such trading activity could potentially affect the \nprice of the Underlying and, accordingly, could affect the investor’s payout on any Note. \nIn purchasing any Notes, purchasers will be deemed to represent and undertake to the Issuer, the Dealer \nand each of their affiliates that (i) such purchaser understands the risks and potential consequences \nassociated with the purchase of the Notes, (ii) that such purchaser has consulted with its own legal, \nregulatory, investment, accounting, tax and other advisers to extent it believes is appropriate to assist it in \nunderstanding and evaluating the risks involved in, and the consequences of, purchasing the Notes and (iii) \nin accordance with the terms set out in Annex 1. \nMorgan Stanley is not qualified to give legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients and does not purport to \ndo so in this document. Clients are urged to seek the advice of their own professional advisers about the \nconsequences of the proposals contained herein. \nGENERAL \n1.

Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 \nto each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the \nobligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category.” \nS&P Global Ratings has, in its January 2021 publication “S&P Global Ratings Definitions” described \na rating of “A” in the following terms: “An obligation rated 'A' is somewhat more susceptible to the \nadverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher- \nrated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitments on the \nobligation is still strong.” \nINTERESTS OF NATURAL AND LEGAL PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE \nSave for any fees payable to the Dealer, so far as the Issuer is aware, no person involved in the \nissue of the Notes has an interest material to the offer.

Ratings \nRatings: The Notes to be issued are expected to be rated: \nA by Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited (“Fitch”) \nHigh credit quality. ‘A’ ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings. \nBaa3 by Moody’s Investors Service (Nordics) AB (“Moody’s”). \nObligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. Modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category. \nBBB+ by S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited (“S&P”), \nAn obligation rated ‘BBB’ exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to weaken the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation. The addition of a plus (+) sign shows relative standing within the rating category. \nThere is no guarantee that any of the above ratings will be maintained following the date of these Final Terms. Up-to- date information should always be sought by direct reference to the relevant rating agency. \nEach of S&P, Fitch and Moody’s is established in the European Union and is registered under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 (as amended). \n3.

Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg, having a share capital of EUR 31,000, and duly registered with the Registre de Commerce et des Sociétés, Luxembourg with number B206430) (“SPIRE”) \nacting in respect of its Compartment 2020-170 \nIssue of Series 2020-170 NOK 250,000,000 Fixed Rate Secured Notes due 2027 \nunder the Secured Note Programme \nThis document is a series memorandum (the “Series Memorandum”), which contains information relating to the above notes (the “Notes”) issued by SPIRE acting in respect of its Compartment 2020-170 (the “Issuer”). This Series Memorandum should be read in conjunction with all documents which are incorporated by reference in the “Documents Incorporated by Reference” section herein, including the relevant sections of the base prospectus dated 3 April 2020 (the “Base Prospectus”) relating to the Secured Note Programme (the “Programme”) of SPIRE. Unless defined herein, terms defined in the Base Prospectus have the same meanings in this Series Memorandum. \nThis Series Memorandum is not an advertisement and neither this Series Memorandum nor the Pricing Terms contained in this Series Memorandum constitutes a prospectus or final terms for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). \nThe Issuer is not offering the Notes in any jurisdiction in circumstances which would require a prospectus pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation. Nor is any person authorised to make such an offer of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer in any jurisdiction. \nApplication has been made to The Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Dublin”), for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin (the “Official List”) and to trading on its Global Exchange Market (“GEM”). This document constitutes listing particulars for the purpose of such application and has been approved by Euronext Dublin. The GEM is not a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments (as amended, “MiFID II”). \nReferences in this Series Memorandum to Notes being “listed” (and all related references) shall mean that such Notes have been admitted to trading on the GEM and have been admitted to the Official List. \nThe Notes are not rated. \nProspective investors should have regard to the risk factors described and referred to under the section of this Series Memorandum titled “Risk Factors” and, in particular, to the limited recourse nature of the Notes and the fact that the Issuer is a special purpose vehicle. \nDealer \nJ.P. Morgan i The Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Series Memorandum. To the best of the Issuer’s knowledge (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this Series Memorandum is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information. \nSolely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. \nThe Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor (and, for the avoidance of doubt, this means any retail investor within or outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United Kingdom (the “UK”)). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “Retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. \nNo key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. \nThe information contained in this Series Memorandum is supplemental to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Base Prospectus (see the section titled “Documents Incorporated by Reference” below). This Series Memorandum includes particulars for the purpose of giving information with regard to the issue by the Issuer of the Notes. \nNo person has been authorised to give any information or to make any representation other than those contained in this Series Memorandum in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes and, if given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorised by the Issuer or the Dealer (as specified in the Pricing Terms contained in this Series Memorandum). Neither the delivery of this Series Memorandum nor any sale of Notes made in connection therewith shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the Issuer since the date of this Series Memorandum or the date upon which this Series Memorandum has been most recently amended or supplemented or that there has been no adverse change in the financial position of the Issuer since the date of this Series Memorandum or the date upon which this Series Memorandum has been most recently amended or supplemented or that any other information supplied in connection with the Programme or the Notes is correct as of any time subsequent to the date on which it is supplied or, if different, the date indicated in the document containing the same. \nThe language of this Series Memorandum is English. Certain legislative references and technical terms have been cited in their original language in order that the correct technical meaning may be ascribed to them under the applicable law. \nThe information on any websites referred to herein does not form part of this Series Memorandum unless that information is incorporated by reference into this Series Memorandum. \nThe distribution of this Series Memorandum and the offering or sale of the Notes in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law.

The Notes have not been and will not ii be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”).

The Dealer makes no representation, express or implied, or, to the fullest extent permitted by law, accepts no responsibility, with respect to (i) the Notes, (ii) the Transaction Documents (including the effectiveness thereof) or (iii) the accuracy or completeness of any of the information in this Series Memorandum or for any other statement made or purported to be made by the Dealer or on its behalf in connection with the Issuer or the issue and offering of the Notes. The Dealer accordingly disclaims all and any liability whether arising in tort or contract or otherwise (save as referred to above) which it might otherwise have in respect of the Notes, the Transaction Documents or this Series Memorandum or any such statement. \nProspective investors should have regard to the factors described under the section headed “Risk Factors” in this Series Memorandum. This Series Memorandum does not describe all of the risks of an investment in the Notes. Neither this Series Memorandum nor any financial statements are intended to provide the basis of any credit or other evaluation and should not be considered as a recommendation by any of the Issuer or the Dealer that any recipient of this Series Memorandum or any other financial statements should purchase the Notes. \nProspective investors should read the section titled “Disclaimers” set out in pages 5 to 8 of the Base Prospectus and ensure that they understand the relevant disclaimers and other information set out therein (which are incorporated by reference into, and form a part of, this Series Memorandum). \nTHE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR WITH ANY SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED iii STATES. NO PERSON HAS REGISTERED NOR WILL REGISTER AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR OF THE ISSUER UNDER THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT OF 1936 AS AMENDED AND THE RULES OF THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (“CFTC”) THEREUNDER. THE NOTES MAY NOT AT ANY TIME BE OFFERED, SOLD OR, WHERE RELEVANT, DELIVERED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, U.S. PERSONS (AS DEFINED IN THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED, AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER). \nCONSEQUENTLY, THE NOTES MAY NOT AT ANY TIME BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT (A) IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED UNDER REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (“REGULATION S”)) AND (B) TO PERSONS THAT ARE (I) NOT U.S. PERSONS (AS DEFINED IN REGULATION S), (II) NOT U.S. PERSONS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT RISK RETENTION REGULATIONS ISSUED UNDER SECTION 15G OF THE U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934) AND (III) NON-UNITED STATES PERSONS (AS DEFINED IN RULE 4.7 UNDER THE U.S. COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT OF 1936, BUT EXCLUDING FOR PURPOSES OF SUBSECTION (D) THEREOF, THE EXCEPTION TO THE EXTENT THAT IT WOULD APPLY TO PERSONS WHO ARE NOT NON- UNITED STATES PERSONS) (ANY PERSON SATISFYING EACH OF (I) TO (III) IMMEDIATELY ABOVE, A “PERMITTED PURCHASER”). IF A PERMITTED PURCHASER ACQUIRING NOTES IS DOING SO FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH OTHER PERSON MUST ALSO BE A PERMITTED PURCHASER. \nTHIS SERIES MEMORANDUM HAS BEEN PREPARED BY THE ISSUER (A) FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER AND SALE OF THE NOTES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES TO PERMITTED PURCHASERS IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 903 OR 904 OF REGULATION S AND (B) FOR THE LISTING AND ADMISSION TO TRADING OF THE NOTES ON THE GLOBAL EXCHANGE MARKET OF EURONEXT DUBLIN. \nIN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS MUST RELY ON THEIR OWN EXAMINATION OF THE ISSUER AND THE TERMS OF THE OFFERING, INCLUDING THE MERITS AND RISKS INVOLVED. \nTHE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION IN THE UNITED STATES OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN THE UNITED STATES, NOR HAVE ANY OF THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES PASSED UPON OR ENDORSED THE MERITS OF THE OFFERING OF ANY SECURITIES PURSUANT TO THIS PROGRAMME OR THE ACCURACY OR THE ADEQUACY OF THIS SERIES MEMORANDUM OR ANY OTHER AUTHORISED OFFERING DOCUMENT.
